description: Education automation designed to streamline operations for students, educators, and school administrators.

**Automate the boring.** At Hogwarts, we're building codebase for school automation, one component at a time. Every line of code is open source, every contribution is valued, and every developer may shape the future of how schools operate.

We sell the origin of value — we sell **Time**, the currency that drives the world — what if you could reclaim yours and focus on what truly matters? It's more than a service — it's an escape from the matrix. A restoration of time through the elimination of repetitive tasks, streamlined operations, and automated processes.

Think of our codebase as a living library where every contribution becomes part of something greater. From atomic components to complete templates, from blocks to micro-services to full automation solutions—we're creating the building blocks that will power education industry.

Follow along as we figure this out together. This isn't just about building software; it's about creating a collaborative ecosystem where developers, businesses, and innovators unite to solve real problems.
