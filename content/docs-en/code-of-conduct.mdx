## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:**

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- Using welcoming and inclusive language

**Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Principles

As a small, fast-moving team building school automation for Sudan, we embrace these principles:

- **Respect first** — Assume positive intent; critique ideas, not people
- **Users over egos** — The school experience is our north star
- **Bias to ship** — Iterate weekly with small, reversible changes
- **Ownership** — See issues through to resolution
- **Transparency** — Async-first communication; write it down

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions, code reviews)
- Discord server and direct messages
- Documentation and comments in code
- Project-related events and meetings (virtual or in-person)

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Communication Guidelines

- Prefer issues/PRs over private messages; document decisions publicly
- Keep standups ≤ 10 minutes; focus on blockers and commitments
- Use clear, action-oriented titles and checklists
- Both Arabic and English are welcome; choose clarity over jargon
- Be mindful of timezone and internet constraints in Sudan

## Collaboration Standards

- Use lightweight RFCs for changes to data model, auth, routing, or billing
- Write or update docs with every notable change
- Pair when unsure; optimize for learning and speed
- Keep PRs small; include context and screenshots/GIFs
- Respect focus time; batch messages; avoid "urgent" without cause

## Technical Responsibilities

- No production secrets in code or chats
- Every data access must include `schoolId` where applicable (multi-tenant safety)
- Add tests for critical flows; fix broken builds before adding new features
- Run validation before commits: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by:

1. **Email**: Contact the Tech Lead directly (confidential)
2. **Discord**: Direct message to a maintainer
3. **GitHub**: Open a private security advisory if code-related

All reports will be reviewed promptly and kept confidential. You will receive a response acknowledging receipt within 48 hours.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Decision-Making Process

For technical and project decisions:

1. **Propose** → **Discuss** → **Decide** → **Document**
2. Disagree and commit once a decision is made
3. Timebox debates; if unresolved, Tech Lead decides and documents rationale

## Conflict Resolution

1. Address issues directly and early
2. Assume miscommunication before malice; seek clarity
3. Focus on behavior, not personality
4. If direct resolution fails, escalate to a maintainer
5. All outcomes will be documented
