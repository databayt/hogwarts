## Requests for new components

If you have a request for a new component, please open a discussion on GitHub. We'll be happy to help you out.

## CLI

The `codebase` package is a CLI for adding components to your project. You can find the documentation for the CLI [here](/docs/cli).

Any changes to the CLI should be made in the `packages/codebase` directory. If you can, it would be great if you could add tests for your changes.

Tests are written using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). You can run all the tests from the root of the repository.

pnpm test
```

Please ensure that the tests are passing when submitting a pull request. If you're adding new features, please include tests.
