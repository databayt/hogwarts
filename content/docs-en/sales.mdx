## Objection Handling

### "We already have a system"

_"I understand. Many schools we work with had existing solutions too. The key difference is that Hogwarts is built specifically for your region with Arabic support from day one—not added as an afterthought. Would you be interested in seeing how our multi-tenant architecture provides better data isolation than your current setup?"_

### "It's too expensive"

_"Let me show you the ROI. A typical school saves 40 admin hours monthly—that's nearly a full-time equivalent. At $750/month for 500 students, you're paying $1.50 per student for comprehensive management. Most schools see the platform pay for itself within 2-3 months through operational savings alone."_

### "We need to involve the ministry/board"

_"Absolutely—this is an important decision. We offer pilot programs specifically designed for stakeholder review. We can run a 3-month pilot with select classes, document the results, and present them to your board/ministry. This gives everyone confidence before full commitment."_

### "What about data security?"

_"Security is our top priority. Each school gets complete data isolation through our multi-tenant architecture with `schoolId` scoping on every database query. We're FERPA and GDPR compliant, use AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, and maintain comprehensive audit trails. We also conduct annual penetration testing and offer a bug bounty program."_
