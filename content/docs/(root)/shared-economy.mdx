**Justice = Fair Access to Resources Based on Evidence of Contribution**

Our shared economy framework ensures every contributor is recognized fairly and compensated justly. It's not just a payment system; it's a transparent, evidence-based valuation engine that treats all forms of contribution—code, documentation, community work—with equal respect. Contributors own their contribution value forever through immutable records.

## Core Principles

1. **Measurable Value** – Every contribution has quantifiable impact
2. **Equal Respect** – Code, docs, and community work are valued equally
3. **Gaming Resistance** – The system detects and prevents manipulation
4. **Transparent Valuations** – All calculations are public and contestable
5. **Immutable Ownership** – Contributors own their contribution value forever

## Contribution Matrix

## Anti-Gaming Mechanisms

### Detection Systems

| Mechanism | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Sybil prevention | GitHub account > 6 months, verified email required |
| Velocity limits | Max 100 commits/day reviewed |
| Peer validation | Large contributions need 2+ maintainer reviews |
| Commit splitting | If 10+ commits could be 1, apply 0.5x multiplier |
| Code churn tax | Code deleted within 30 days = retroactive -50% points |
| Test quality | Tests that mock everything = 0 points |
| Collusion detection | 80%+ review overlap flagged for human review |
| Circular endorsement | A↔B mutual reviews = 0.7x multiplier |

### Transparency Layer

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Public ledger | Every contribution → permanent record with hash |
| Formula visibility | Point calculation in `src/contribution-engine/formulas.ts` |
| Monthly reports | Auto-generated contribution reports (Markdown + PDF) |
| Dispute process | Any contributor can challenge valuation via issue |
| Audit trail | Auto-generated breakdown in commit metadata |
| Historical changes | All formula changes tracked in git with rationale |
| Maintainer override | Requires 2/3 vote + public justification |

## Valuation Formula

### Hourly Rate Floor

Based on 2024 research: **$45 USD/hour minimum** (COCOMO standard)

<div className="p-4 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg my-4 font-mono text-sm">
  <p>Contribution Value = (Base Points × Quality Multiplier × Impact Factor) / Effort Hours</p>
  <p className="mt-2">If Contribution Value is below $45/hour → Adjusted Value = $45 × Effort Hours</p>
</div>

| Effort Estimation | Method |
|-------------------|--------|
| Self-reported | Honor system + peer validation |
| Auto-detected | Commit timestamps via GitHub API |
| Code contributions | COCOMO II formula (industry-standard) |
| Outlier detection | 100 lines claimed as 20 hours → flagged |

### Underpayment Prevention

| Protection | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Market rate adjustment | Quarterly review vs Upwork/Toptal rates |
| Cost-of-living index | High-COL contributors not penalized |
| Skill premium | Senior developers get 1.5-2x multiplier |
| Minimum wage alert | Earnings below local equivalent → alert |
| Profit redistribution | 40%+ margin while under $30/hr pay → redistribution |
| Satisfaction survey | Annual anonymous contributor review |

## Diverse Contribution Recognition

## Example Calculations

### Junior Developer First Contribution

Bug fix in authentication flow (50 lines TypeScript)

| Calculation | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Base points | 50 lines × 1.0 (TS) × 1.5 (bug fix) = 75 |
| Quality multiplier | 1.2 (tests pass) × 1.5 (includes tests) = 1.8 |
| Impact factor | Critical bug = 5x |
| Total points | 75 × 1.8 × 5 = **675** |
| Effort | 4 hours |
| Raw value | $67.50 (675/10 rate) |
| Adjusted | $45/hour floor = $180 |
| First contribution bonus | 1.5x = **$270** |

### Designer Creates Onboarding Flow

5 screens, user testing with 10 users, Figma documentation

| Calculation | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| UI mockups | 100 × 5 screens = 500 |
| User testing | 30 × 10 users = 300 |
| Documentation | 20 |
| Total points | **820** |
| Effort | 16 hours |
| Hourly rate | $51.25 (above floor) |

### Community Manager Monthly Work

Forum moderation, onboarded 3 contributors, organized 1 event

| Calculation | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Moderation | 5 pts/hr × 20 hours = 100 |
| Onboarding | 50 × 3 = 150 |
| Event | 100 |
| Discord support | 2 × 50 responses = 100 |
| Total points | **450** |
| Effort | ~25 hours |
| Adjusted | $45/hour = **$1,125** |

## Open Questions

| Question | Consideration |
|----------|---------------|
| Time Decay | Should old contributions lose value over time? |
| Team Contributions | How to split points for pair programming? |
| Failed Experiments | Should exploratory work that doesn't ship earn points? |
| Competitive Dynamics | Does leaderboard create toxic vs. healthy motivation? |
| Global Equity | How to balance COL differences without geographic arbitrage? |

## Justice Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Evidence** | Objective, measurable, auditable contribution data |
| **Transparency** | Public formulas, contestable outcomes |
| **Dignity** | No contributor earns below fair wage, all work is valued |

This framework ensures that every contributor is recognized fairly, compensated justly, and empowered to build together.
