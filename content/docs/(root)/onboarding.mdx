## Onboarding (Blocks, Flows, and Patterns)

This guide documents the reusable Onboarding block that handles user joining and school setup flows: create school, invite admins/teachers/parents, add students, subjects, and initial timetable basics.

### Architecture Overview

- UI: shadcn/ui primitives (Input, Button, Select, Dialog, Sheet) composed into small steps.
- Forms: React Hook Form for controlled state with minimal re-renders.
- Validation: Zod schemas collocated per feature; parsed again on the server.
- Actions: Next.js Server Actions ("use server") for mutations, revalidate and redirect on success.
- Tenancy: all writes include schoolId, derived from subdomain/session.

### Folder Pattern (per feature)

```
src/components/onboarding/
  actions.ts        # server actions (createSchool, inviteUser, seedDefaults)
  validation.ts     # zod schemas
  types.ts          # shared types
  form.tsx          # RHF form(s)
  content.tsx       # step content composition
```

### Zod + RHF Example

```tsx
import { z } from "zod"
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

const schema = z.object({
  schoolName: z.string().min(2),
  email: z.string().email(),
})

export function CreateSchoolForm({ onSubmit }: { onSubmit: (v: z.infer<typeof schema>) => Promise<void> }) {
  const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof schema>>({ resolver: zodResolver(schema) })

  return (
    <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(async (v) => { await onSubmit(v) })} className="space-y-3">
      <Input placeholder="School name" {...form.register("schoolName")} />
      <Input type="email" placeholder="Email" {...form.register("email")} />
      <Button type="submit">Create</Button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

### Server Action Pattern

```ts
"use server"
import { z } from "zod"
import { db } from "@/lib/db"

const createSchool = z.object({ schoolName: z.string().min(2), email: z.string().email() })

export async function createSchoolAction(values: z.infer<typeof createSchool>) {
  const parsed = createSchool.parse(values)
  const school = await db.school.create({ data: { name: parsed.schoolName, email: parsed.email } })
  return { ok: true, schoolId: school.id }
}
```

### Flow Orchestration

1) Owner: Create school -> choose plan (trial by default) -> invite admin.
2) Admin: Configure classes and subjects -> invite teachers and parents.
3) Teacher: Join class -> mark attendance -> post first announcement.
4) Parent: Accept invite -> verify -> view child.

Use sheets/dialogs to segment steps, keep forms minimal, and show toasts for feedback. Mirror UI for RTL.

### Multi-tenant Considerations

- Derive schoolId from subdomain/session and include in every mutation.
- Seed defaults per school (roles, example classes/subjects) via server action.
- Enforce unique constraints scoped by schoolId in Prisma schema.

### Checklists

- Form + schema + action exist and are wired.
- Success and error toasts present.
- Revalidate path or redirect after mutations.
- Add tests or manual steps in PR.
