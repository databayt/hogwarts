## Email Template: Cold Outreach to Schools

```
Subject: Free 3-Month Pilot - School Management System

Dear [Principal/Administrator Name],

I'm reaching out because [School Name] appears to be a growing
private school in [City], and I believe we can help you save
significant time on administrative work.

Problem: Most schools still manage students, attendance, grades,
and timetables using Excel, paper, and WhatsApp.

Solution: I built a complete cloud-based school management system
specifically for schools in the Middle East.

Features:
✓ Student & teacher management
✓ Attendance tracking (QR, manual, bulk)
✓ Exam scheduling & grading
✓ Timetable builder
✓ Parent portal
✓ Arabic/English, RTL support

Offer: FREE 3-month pilot with hands-on setup support.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
