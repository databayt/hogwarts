## Timetable — Admin Guide

This guide shows Admins/Owners how to configure working days and lunch, manage weekly slots, detect and resolve conflicts, and print clean A4 timetables.

### Permissions

- Mutations (saving schedule, creating/editing slots) require Admin, Owner, or Developer roles.
- All operations are tenant‑scoped by `schoolId`.

### Configure Working Days and Lunch

1) Open the Timetable page.
2) Click “Schedule settings”.
3) Choose working days (e.g., Sun–Thu or your school’s pattern) and select “Lunch after period” if applicable.
4) Save. Changes apply to the selected term and propagate to the timetable grid and printing.

Notes:
- Working days can vary by school and term (e.g., Friday off; Friday+Saturday off; Friday+Sunday off).
- Lunch row is inserted after your chosen period in the grid and print.

### Add or Edit Timetable Slots

1) Click “Edit slots”.
2) Pick Day, Period, Class (A/B/C/D…), Teacher, and Classroom.
3) Save to create/update the weekly slot.

Tips:
- Use grade + section naming (e.g., Grade 1 A/B/C/D) to manage multi‑class grades.
- Teacher timetables are supported via the view switch (Class vs Teacher).

### Detect and Resolve Conflicts

Conflict types:
- Teacher conflict: Same teacher assigned to two classes at the same time.
- Room conflict: Same room assigned to two classes at the same time.

Workflow:
1) In the header, check the conflict counter. Click it to open the Conflicts drawer.
2) Each conflict lists the affected classes. Click “Suggest for teacher” or “Suggest for room” to fetch free slots.
3) Click “Apply” on a suggestion to pre‑fill the Slot Editor with that day/period.
4) Save the slot to resolve the conflict.

### Print (A4)

- The Timetable page supports A4 printing with page‑break helpers and row‑split prevention.
- Use browser print (Ctrl/Cmd + P). Choose A4 portrait. Dark UI accents are stripped for readability.

### Multi‑Tenant Safety

- Every action/query includes `schoolId` from the tenant context (subdomain/session/impersonation).
- Data changes affect only the current school and selected term.

### Troubleshooting

- No terms listed: ensure academic years/terms exist for the school.
- Missing periods: define periods under the school year; timetable needs period names and times.
- Empty suggestions: the teacher/room may be fully occupied for selected days; try another day or adjust schedule settings.

### Technical Reference

- Schedule config APIs: `GET /api/schedule?termId=…`, `POST /api/schedule/config`
- Weekly data API: `GET /api/timetable?termId=…&weekOffset=0|1&classId=…&teacherId=…`
- Conflicts: `GET /api/timetable/conflicts?termId=…`
- Suggestions: `GET /api/timetable/suggest?termId=…&teacherId=…&classroomId=…`
- Slot upsert: `POST /api/timetable/slot`

### Local Testing Without Subdomains

If tenant context (subdomain/session) isn’t available locally, you can pass a school domain to the public fallbacks:

- Terms: `GET /api/terms?domain=khartoum`
- Timetable: `GET /api/timetable?domain=khartoum&weekOffset=0`

Available demo domains (seeded): `khartoum`, `omdurman`, `portsudan`, `wadmadani`.
