# Block Rebound Workflow

The Block Rebound workflow systematically optimizes any platform block for production-readiness through competitor research, technical assessment, and actionable recommendations.

## Quick Start

Simply say one of these to trigger the workflow:

```bash
rebound finance
rebound the attendance block
optimize students for production
make grades production-ready
```

Or use the slash command:

```bash
/rebound finance
/rebound attendance
```

## Why Block Rebound?

Before Block Rebound, optimizing a block required writing detailed prompts like:

```
ultrathink This is a multi tenant schools management system,
and I wanted to have advance attendance feature. I want you
to look at competitors search the web to see what is the best
practices to follow with src/components/platform/attendance/
optimize it to solve real problems to be practical and useful
and integrate well with other blocks and be production ready
```

Now, you just say: **rebound attendance**

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Research (5-10 min)

Competitive intelligence gathering:

- **Web search** for top 5 competitors in the domain
- **Feature benchmarking** matrix comparison
- **Industry best practices** identification
- **Innovation opportunities** discovery

Example searches for finance block:
- "best school fee management software 2025"
- "school billing system features"
- "education payment gateway integration"

### Phase 2: Assessment (10-15 min)

Technical evaluation of current implementation:

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Architecture | Mirror pattern, server/client boundaries |
| Multi-tenant | schoolId in all queries |
| Security | Validation, auth checks, OWASP |
| Performance | N+1 queries, bundle size |
| UX | Loading states, error handling |
| i18n | Arabic/English coverage |
| Tests | Coverage target: 95% |

### Phase 3: Checklist (5 min)

Prioritized production checklist with effort estimates:

| Priority | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Must fix before production | Security vulnerabilities, multi-tenant issues |
| **High** | Should fix soon | Missing core features, performance issues |
| **Medium** | Plan for near-term | Enhancements, i18n gaps |
| **Low** | Backlog | Nice-to-have features |

### Phase 4: Recommendations (5 min)

Strategic improvement plan:

- **Quick wins** - High impact, low effort tasks
- **Implementation phases** - Weekly breakdown
- **Dependencies** - Task relationships
- **Success metrics** - Production-ready criteria

## Valid Blocks

### Core
`dashboard` `profile` `settings` `admin`

### People
`students` `teachers` `parents` `staff`

### Academic
`subjects` `classes` `lessons` `timetable` `attendance`

### Assessment
`exams` `assignments` `grades`

### Finance
`finance` `fees` `billing` `invoice` `receipt` `banking` `salary` `expenses` `payroll` `budget` `wallet` `accounts`

### Operations
`announcements` `messaging` `notifications` `events` `library`

## Output

Reports are saved to:

```
.claude/workflows/rebound-outputs/{block}/rebound-{date}.md
```

Each report contains:
1. **Research findings** - Competitor analysis, feature gaps
2. **Technical assessment** - Scores and issues found
3. **Production checklist** - Prioritized tasks with estimates
4. **Recommendations** - Quick wins and implementation phases

## Integration

Block Rebound integrates with existing agents:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/agents/security` | Security deep-dive |
| `/agents/multi-tenant` | Tenant isolation verification |
| `/agents/performance` | Performance optimization |
| `/agents/i18n` | Translation audit |

And skills:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `multi-tenant-validator` | schoolId verification |
| `security-scanner` | OWASP compliance |
| `prisma-optimizer` | Query analysis |
| `react-performance` | Component optimization |

## Success Criteria

A block is **production-ready** when:

- [ ] Zero critical issues
- [ ] Zero high-priority security issues
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage
- [ ] 100% i18n coverage (Arabic + English)
- [ ] All core features implemented
- [ ] Performance within targets (&lt;200ms API, &lt;100KB bundle)
- [ ] Accessibility compliant (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive
