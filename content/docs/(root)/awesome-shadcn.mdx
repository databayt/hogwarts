## Awesome shadcn

shadcn/ui is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable React components built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It's not a component library you install as a dependency, but rather a collection of components you copy into your project.

The shadcn/ui ecosystem has grown into a vibrant community of developers building amazing tools, components, and resources on top of the original shadcn/ui library. This curated collection showcases the best of what the community has to offer.
