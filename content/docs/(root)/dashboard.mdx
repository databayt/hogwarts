## Role-Based Architecture

The dashboard uses a **switch-case routing pattern** in `content.tsx`:

```tsx
switch (userRole) {
  case "STUDENT":
    return <StudentDashboard user={user} dictionary={safeDict} locale={locale} />;
  case "TEACHER":
    return <TeacherDashboard user={user} dictionary={safeDict} locale={locale} />;
  case "GUARDIAN":
    return <ParentDashboard user={user} dictionary={safeDict} locale={locale} />;
  case "STAFF":
    return <StaffDashboard user={user} dictionary={safeDict} locale={locale} />;
  case "ADMIN":
  case "DEVELOPER":
    return <AdminDashboard user={user} dictionary={safeDict} locale={locale} />;
  case "PRINCIPAL":
    return <PrincipalDashboard user={user} dictionary={safeDict} locale={locale} />;
  case "ACCOUNTANT":
    return <AccountantDashboard user={user} dictionary={safeDict} locale={locale} />;
  default:
    return <DefaultDashboard user={user} dictionary={safeDict} />;
}
```

## Server Actions

Dashboard data is fetched via server actions in `actions.ts`:

| Action | Returns | Used By |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `getDashboardSummary()` | All metrics aggregated | Admin |
| `getEnrollmentMetrics()` | Student counts | Admin, Principal |
| `getAttendanceMetrics()` | Attendance rates | Admin, Principal, Teacher |
| `getStaffMetrics()` | Teacher counts | Admin, Principal |
| `getAcademicPerformanceMetrics()` | GPA, exams, assignments | Principal, Teacher |
| `getAnnouncementsMetrics()` | Announcement counts | All roles |
| `getClassesMetrics()` | Class counts, ratios | Admin, Principal |
| `getRecentActivities()` | Activity feed | Admin |
| `getTeacherDashboardData()` | Teacher-specific data | Teacher |
| `getStudentDashboardData()` | Student-specific data | Student |
| `getParentDashboardData()` | Parent-specific data | Parent |
| `getPrincipalDashboardData()` | Principal-specific data | Principal |

---

## Component Architecture Pattern

Each role-based dashboard follows the same structure:

```tsx
export async function RoleDashboard({ user, dictionary, locale }: Props) {
  try {
    // 1. Fetch data from server action
    const data = await getRoleDashboardData();

    // 2. Get tenant context
    const { schoolId } = await getTenantContext();

    // 3. Get school info for URLs
    const school = await db.school.findUnique({ where: { id: schoolId } });

    // 4. Get dictionary with fallback
    const dashDict = dictionary?.roleDashboard || { /* defaults */ };

    // 5. Prepare derived data (rings, charts, etc.)
    const activityData = [/* ... */];

    // 6. Render sections
    return (
      <div className="space-y-6">
        <WelcomeBanner ... />
        <MetricCards ... />
        <QuickActions ... />
        <MainContentGrid ... />
        <SecondaryContentGrid ... />
        <ProgressCards ... />
      </div>
    );
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
    return <ErrorCard message={error.message} />;
  }
}
```
