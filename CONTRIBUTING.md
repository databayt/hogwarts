## About this repository

This repository is a modern, multi-tenant school platform built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Prisma.

- We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) for package management.
- We use [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org) with App Router for the frontend.
- We use [Prisma](https://prisma.io) for database management.
- We use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for our component library.
- We use [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev) for authentication.

## Structure

The codebase follows a mirror-pattern architecture: every URL under `src/app` has a corresponding feature directory under `src/components` for its component logic. For documentation and data-table features, we refer only to their top-level directories.

```text

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |

### Mirror pattern: URL ↔ directory

If you can see a URL, you should know where to find its code.

```text
URL: /feature-x

src/app/feature-x/        # Next.js route files
src/components/feature-x/ # Component logic for that route
```

### Standardized file patterns (deeper layers)

For deeper feature directories (e.g., under `src/components/platform/dashboard`), follow the standardized file pattern inspired by our documentation (`src/app/docs/architecture/page.mdx`) and its reference table (`src/app/docs/architecture/standardized-file-patterns.tsx`):

| File                    | Purpose                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content.tsx`           | Compose feature/page UI: headings, sections, layout orchestration. |
| `action.ts`             | Server actions & API calls: validate, scope tenant, mutate.        |
| `constant.ts`           | Enums, option lists, labels, defaults for the feature.             |
| `validation.ts`         | Zod schemas & refinements; parse and infer types.                  |
| `type.ts`               | Domain and UI types; generic helpers for forms/tables.             |
| `form.tsx`              | Typed forms (RHF) with resolvers and submit handling.              |
| `card.tsx`              | Card components for KPIs, summaries, quick actions.                |
| `all.tsx`               | List view with table, filters, pagination.                         |
| `featured.tsx`          | Curated feature list showcasing selections.                        |
| `detail.tsx`            | Detail view with sections, relations, actions.                     |
| `util.ts`               | Pure utilities and mappers used in the feature.                    |
| `column.tsx`            | Typed table column builders and cell renderers.                    |
| `use-abc.ts`            | Feature hooks: fetching, mutations, derived state.                 |
| `README.md`             | Feature README: purpose, APIs, decisions.                          |
| `ISSUE.md`              | Known issues and follow-ups for the feature.                       |

Use these names consistently across features to keep the codebase discoverable and composable.

## Components

We use shadcn/ui as our component foundation. You can find the component configuration in `components.json`.

When adding or modifying components:

1. Follow shadcn/ui patterns and naming conventions (keep components minimal and composable).
2. Maintain consistency with existing components, colocating logic under the mirrored `src/components/<feature>` path.
3. Add proper TypeScript types.
4. Include validation using Zod when handling inputs.
5. Test components and flows thoroughly.

## Commit convention

- `chore`: repository chores

Example: `feat(dashboard): add KPI cards`
