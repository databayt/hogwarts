/**
 * Main Prisma Schema File
 * This file defines the datasource and generator configuration for the Prisma Client.
 * Multi-file Schema Structure:
 * - This file: Datasource and generator configuration
 * - prisma.config.ts: Schema path, migrations, and seed configuration
 * - prisma/models/*.prisma: 33 model files with business logic
 * All *.prisma files in the prisma directory (including subdirectories)
 * are automatically included when prisma.config.ts points to the prisma folder.
 * Note: The datasource URL in prisma.config.ts can override the URL defined here,
 * but the datasource block itself must remain in the schema.
