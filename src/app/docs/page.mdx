## Introduction

**Hogwarts** is school automation. Cloud based. One central database and logic, many schools — each with its own domain and theme.

### Highlights

- Multi-tenant by design: every record is scoped by `schoolId`
- Custom subdomains per school (e.g., `school.hogwarts.app`)
- Role-based access: Owner, Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent, Accountant
- Core features: attendance, timetable (basic), announcements, settings, billing (manual-friendly)
- Arabic‑first (RTL) with English alongside it
- Low-bandwidth UX: light pages and assets
- Secure authentication, permissions, and auditability
