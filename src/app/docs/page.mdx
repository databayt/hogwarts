## Introduction

**Hogwarts** is a multi‑tenant school cloud for Sudan. One central database and logic, many schools — each with its own domain, theme, and language (Arabic/English, RTL/LTR).

These docs focus on the product, architecture, and how to run and develop the app.

### 1) Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

If Prisma models changed, run:

```bash
pnpm prisma generate
pnpm prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### 2) Project map (what lives where)

- Routes live in `src/app/...`
- Components live in `src/components/...`
- Each feature mirrors its route: `app/feature` ↔ `components/feature`
- Standard files per feature: `actions.ts`, `validation.ts`, `types.ts`, `form.tsx`, `content.tsx`

### 3) Build and verify

1. Make a small change locally
2. Run `pnpm build` to verify type safety and catch errors
3. Start the app and validate the change in the browser

### 4) Core product in one minute

- Multi-tenant: every record belongs to a school via `schoolId`
- Provisioning: each school gets a subdomain (e.g., `school.hogwarts.app`)
- Roles: Owner, Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent, Accountant
- First features: attendance, timetable (basic), announcements, settings, billing (manual-friendly)

### 5) Stack (what we use)

- Next.js, React, TypeScript
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Prisma + Neon (Postgres)
- Auth.js, Zod, React Hook Form

### 6) Key links

- Requirements: `/docs/requeriments`
- Architecture: `/docs/architecture`
- Stack: `/docs/stack` — Onboarding: `/docs/onboarding`
- Database: `/docs/database`
- Roadmap & Changelog: `/docs/roadmap`, `/docs/changelog`

### Notes for Sudan context

- Arabic-first (RTL) with English alongside it
- Low bandwidth: keep pages light; avoid large images
- Manual payments: billing supports receipt upload from day one
