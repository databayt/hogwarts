## Dashboards (Operator and Client)

Two dashboards share one central codebase and database:

- Operator Dashboard (platform team): run the SaaS - schools, billing, domains, moderation, observability.
- Client Dashboard (per school): run the school - roles, classes, subjects, students, teachers, timetable, attendance, announcements, billing.

Both follow the same patterns: shadcn/ui components, URL-to-state sync where useful, Prisma with tenant scoping, and server actions for mutations.

### Architecture

- Multi-tenant shared schema (Neon + Prisma). Every business table includes schoolId.
- Tenant resolution via subdomain (for example, hogwarts.hogwarts.app) and session.
- Central logic: shared actions, filters, table block, and role gates.
- RBAC: Owner, Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent, Accountant (add Staff or Support for Operator).

### Operator Dashboard (Platform)

Scope:

- Schools: list, create, suspend, plan, limits, trial countdown.
- Domains: subdomain issuance, custom domain requests, CNAME verification.
- Billing: invoices, manual receipts, refunds, revenue metrics.
- Observability: logs, error reports, backups status, job queue.
- Moderation and Support: impersonate (audited), reset domain, manage users.

Implementation:

- Routes under app/operator/* or app/(operator)/* with guard middleware.
- Lists use the generic table block (/docs/table), filtering by any platform fields.
- Server actions for domain approval, plan changes, suspensions.
- Role gates: RoleGate for platform roles (for example, DEVELOPER, STAFF).

Tenant safety:

- Platform views can search across all schools. Mutations must specify the target schoolId and log an audit entry.
- Impersonation creates an audit trail (who, when, why) and a time-limited session.

### Client Dashboard (Per School)

Scope:

- Setup: profile, branding, locale and timezone, domain request.
- People: users and roles, parents, students, teachers.
- Structure: classes, subjects, timetable slots.
- Operations: attendance, announcements.
- Billing: plan, trial, invoices, manual receipt upload.

Implementation:

- Subdomain-based routing: school.hogwarts.app resolves to schoolId.
- All server queries include schoolId (inject from middleware or context).
- Lists reuse the generic table; columns define filters via meta.variant and options.
- Server actions for all mutations, revalidate paths after changes.

RBAC examples:

- Owner or Admin: full access. Teacher: classes they teach. Parent: linked students. Student: own data.

### Data Flow (Both Dashboards)

1) Resolve tenant and role.
2) Parse URL for filters, sort, page.
3) Build Prisma where and orderBy, with schoolId enforced for client dashboard; optional for operator dashboard.
4) Fetch data and total, then compute pageCount.
5) Render with table block; server actions mutate and revalidate.

### Production Readiness

- Security: least privilege, audit trails for sensitive actions (domain, billing, impersonation).
- Tenant isolation: all client queries and unique constraints scoped by schoolId.
- Observability: request IDs, schoolId, and user ID in logs; error tracking with release tags.
- Backups and disaster recovery: daily backups, retention 7 and 30 days; restore drills.
- Internationalization and RTL: Arabic and English; mirrored icons and arrows.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation and roles across both UIs.
- Performance: indexes for frequent filters; pagination; avoid N+1; cache lists where safe.

### Reuse and Extensibility

- Reuse table, filters, operators, and toolbars for any list (students, teachers, invoices, domains).
- Define column factories per domain; keep server query helpers tenant-aware.
- Centralize role gates and nav items by role; show or hide features by plan.
