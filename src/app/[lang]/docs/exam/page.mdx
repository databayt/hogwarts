## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I edit an exam after students have started taking it?**

**Q: How do I handle makeup exams for absent students?**
A: Create a separate exam for makeup or add marks manually later.

**Q: Can I reuse questions from previous exams?**
A: Yes, questions in the bank can be used in multiple exams. Use randomization to prevent cheating.
