- Invalid email format
- Missing required fields (name, relationship)

### Issue: Document upload fails

- Unsupported format (use PDF, JPG, PNG only)
- Network timeout (try again)

### Issue: Status change blocked
**Possible Causes**:
- Outstanding fees (settle dues first for transfers)
- Active suspension (cannot graduate while suspended)
