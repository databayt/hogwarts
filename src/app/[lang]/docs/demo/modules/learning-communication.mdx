**Objective**: Understand how Library, LMS, and Announcements integrate with other platform modules.

**Integration Points**:

#### **Library + Student Management**:
- Student borrowing limits based on student status (active/suspended)
- Disciplinary action: Suspend library privileges
- Guardian notifications for overdue books
- Borrowing history linked to student profile

**Example Workflow**:
1. Student borrows book (Library module)
2. Due date passes without return
3. System generates overdue notice (Communication)
4. Guardian receives email notification
5. Late fee added to student financial account (Finance module)
6. If multiple overdue: Library privileges suspended (Student Management)

---

#### **LMS + Finance**:
- Paid course purchases
- Payment processing integration
- Student wallet for course purchases
- Revenue tracking for course sales
- Enrollment refunds

**Example Workflow**:
1. Student views paid course (LMS)
2. Clicks "Purchase Course" (SDG 100)
3. Payment modal integrates with Finance module
4. Student pays via:
   - School wallet (deduct SDG 100)
   - Credit card (payment gateway)
   - Bank transfer (manual approval)
5. Payment confirmed → Student automatically enrolled
6. Invoice generated (Finance module)
7. Receipt sent to student email (Communication)
8. Revenue recorded in financial reports

---

#### **Announcements + All Modules**:
- System-generated announcements from any module
- Examples:
  - **Attendance**: "Your child was absent on [date]"
  - **Exams**: "Exam results published for [exam name]"
  - **Finance**: "Invoice due in 3 days"
  - **Library**: "Book due tomorrow: [book title]"
  - **LMS**: "New lesson available in [course name]"
  - **Assignments**: "Assignment due tomorrow: [assignment title]"

**Example Workflow**:
1. Teacher publishes exam results (Exam module)
2. System automatically creates announcement:
   ```
   Title: "Exam Results Published: Midterm Mathematics"
   Body: "Your midterm exam results are now available."
   Scope: Class (Grade 10A Mathematics)
   Priority: Important
   ```
3. Announcement sent to all students in class
4. Students receive in-app + email notification
5. Parents receive email (if enabled)
6. Students click notification → Redirects to exam results page

---

#### **Library + LMS Resource Integration**:
- Link library books to course lessons
- Course reading lists
- Reserve books for courses
- Track book usage by course

**Example Workflow**:
1. Instructor creates LMS course "History of Sudan"
2. Adds lesson "Ancient Nubian Kingdoms"
3. Links library book: "Sudan: Ancient History" as required reading
4. Book marked as "Reserved for Course" in library
5. Students enrolled in course see book in "Recommended Resources"
6. Students can borrow book directly from course page
7. Borrowing tracked against course completion metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Library Module**:

**Issue**: Cannot borrow book - "Already borrowed maximum books"
- **Cause**: Student has reached borrowing limit (3 books for students)
- **Solution**: Return existing books first, or admin can increase limit

**Issue**: Book shows as "Available" but cannot borrow
- **Cause**: Book reserved for specific class/course
- **Solution**: Check if book is reserved, or contact librarian

**Issue**: Late fee calculation incorrect
- **Cause**: Due date or late fee rate misconfigured
- **Solution**: Admin checks Settings → Library → Late Fee Rate (default: SDG 2/day)

---

#### **LMS Module**:

**Issue**: Cannot access paid course after payment
- **Cause**: Payment not confirmed or enrollment failed
- **Solution**: Check Finance → Invoices for payment status, or contact admin to manually enroll

**Issue**: Lesson video won't play
- **Cause**: Invalid video URL or format not supported
- **Solution**: Instructor checks video URL, ensure YouTube/Vimeo link is correct, or re-upload video

**Issue**: Progress not saving
- **Cause**: Browser cookies blocked or session expired
- **Solution**: Enable cookies, refresh page, log out and log back in

**Issue**: Certificate not generating after completion
- **Cause**: Not all lessons marked complete, or quiz requirements not met
- **Solution**: Check course progress, ensure 100% completion, complete any required quizzes

---

#### **Communication Module**:

**Issue**: Announcement not received by students
- **Cause**: Scope misconfigured or notification settings disabled
- **Solution**: Check announcement scope, verify student email settings, check notification preferences

**Issue**: Email notifications not sending
- **Cause**: Email server not configured or student email invalid
- **Solution**: Admin checks Settings → Email → SMTP Configuration, verify student emails in database

**Issue**: Cannot create announcement - "Permission denied"
- **Cause**: User role lacks permission to create announcements
- **Solution**: Teachers can only announce to their classes, other scopes require admin role

**Issue**: Scheduled announcement didn't send
- **Cause**: Server cron job not running or timezone misconfigured
- **Solution**: Admin checks server cron jobs, verify timezone in Settings → General → Timezone
