# Attendance System Demo

Complete guide to the comprehensive attendance tracking system with 4 marking methods, real-time analytics, and automated alerts.

## Overview

The Demo School has **~5,000 attendance records** spanning 20 school days across 10 classes. The system supports:
- ✅ **Manual marking** (daily & period-wise)
- ✅ **QR code check-in** (contactless)
- ✅ **Barcode scanning** (ID cards)
- ✅ **Geo-fencing** (GPS-based)
- ✅ **Real-time analytics** (trends, at-risk students)
- ✅ **Automated alerts** (parent notifications)

## Quick Access

**Demo Data Statistics**:
- **Total Records**: ~5,000 (20 days × 10 classes × 25 students)
- **Attendance Rate**: 87% average (87% present, 8% absent, 3% late, 2% excused)
- **Classes with Data**: 10 classes (Math, Physics, Chemistry, English across grades)
- **Date Range**: Last 20 school days (Monday-Friday only)
- **At-Risk Students**: ~15 students (<75% attendance)

## Feature Walkthroughs

### 1. Manual Attendance Marking - Daily (5 minutes)

**Access**: `/en/s/demo/platform/attendance/daily/{classId}`

**Use Case**: Primary schools, homeroom teachers marking entire class

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to Attendance → Daily
2. Select class from dropdown (e.g., "Math - Grade 10 - Section A")
3. Select date (default: today)
4. View student list with photos and names
5. Mark status for each student:
   - **Present** (✅ green)
   - **Absent** (❌ red)
   - **Late** (⏰ yellow)
   - **Excused** (📝 blue)
6. Optional: Add notes for absent/late students
7. Quick actions:
   - "Mark All Present" (default all to present)
   - "Mark All Absent" (rare, use for holidays)
8. Click "Save Attendance"
9. Confirmation: "Attendance saved for {class} on {date}"

**Demo Testing**:
```
Class: Math - Grade 10 - Section A
Students: 25
Date: Today
Time: 2 minutes (using "Mark All Present" then adjust exceptions)
```

**Result**:
- Attendance records created
- Parent notifications sent for absences (if enabled)
- Dashboard statistics updated

---

### 2. Manual Attendance Marking - Period-Wise (7 minutes)

**Access**: `/en/s/demo/platform/attendance/period/{classId}`

**Use Case**: Secondary schools, subject teachers marking each period

**Differences from Daily**:
- ✅ Period selector (Period 1-8)
- ✅ More granular tracking (student can be absent Period 1, present Period 2)
- ✅ Aggregates to daily summary automatically

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to Attendance → Period-Wise
2. Select class (e.g., "Physics - Grade 11 - Section B")
3. Select date
4. **Select period** (e.g., Period 3: 10:00-11:00 AM)
5. Mark attendance for that specific period
6. Save
7. Repeat for each period you teach

**Workflow Example** (Physics Teacher):
```
Monday:
- Period 1 (8:00-9:00): Physics Grade 11 Section A
- Period 3 (10:00-11:00): Physics Grade 11 Section B
- Period 6 (2:00-3:00): Physics Grade 12 Section A

Teacher marks attendance 3 times (once per period)
```

**Daily Aggregation Logic**:
- If student absent in ANY period → Daily status = Absent
- If student present in ALL periods → Daily status = Present
- If student late to ANY period → Daily status includes "Late" flag
- Percentage calculation: (Periods present / Total periods scheduled) × 100%

**Demo Data**:
- Period-wise data available for last 10 days
- Shows variety: Student present P1-P3, absent P4-P6 (left early)

---

### 3. QR Code Check-In (5 minutes)

**Access**: `/en/s/demo/platform/attendance/qr-code`

**Use Case**: Fast check-in at school entrance, events, assemblies

**How It Works**:
1. **Teacher generates QR code**:
   - Navigate to Attendance → QR Code
   - Select class + period
   - Click "Generate QR Code"
   - QR code displays on screen (valid for 5 minutes)
2. **Display QR code**:
   - Project on classroom screen OR
   - Print and place at entrance
3. **Students scan with phone**:
   - Open mobile browser or QR app
   - Scan code
   - System records attendance as "Present"
   - Student sees confirmation message
4. **Real-time list**:
   - Teacher sees students checking in live
   - Missing students visible immediately
5. **Code expiry**:
   - After 5 minutes, code expires
   - Generate new code if needed

**Security Features**:
- ✅ **Time-limited**: 5-minute expiry prevents sharing
- ✅ **Class-specific**: QR code tied to specific class
- ✅ **Geo-fencing** (optional): Validates student location
- ✅ **One-time use**: Cannot scan same code twice
- ✅ **Audit trail**: Tracks scan time, device, IP

**Demo Testing**:
```bash
# Simulate QR check-in:
1. Generate QR for "Math - Grade 10 - A" Period 1
2. QR code: https://ed.databayt.org/attendance/checkin?token=xxx
3. Student scans → Attendance marked
4. Check real-time list → Student appears
5. Try scanning again → Error: "Already checked in"
6. Wait 5 minutes → Error: "QR code expired"
```

**Benefits**:
- ⚡ **Fast**: 100+ students check in within 5 minutes
- 📱 **Contactless**: No shared devices
- 🎯 **Accurate**: Eliminates proxy attendance
- 📊 **Real-time**: Instant visibility

- Or use phone camera as scanner

**Workflow**:
1. Navigate to Attendance → Barcode
2. Select class + period
3. Click "Start Scanning"
4. Students present ID card
5. Scan barcode → Student marked present
6. Next student → Repeat
7. Click "Finish" when done

- Students below threshold → Notified 2 weeks before exam

**Report Cards**:
- Attendance percentage displayed on report card
- Absence count and late count listed
- Comments: "Excellent attendance" or "Attendance needs improvement"

**Financial System**:
- Some schools tie fee payment to attendance
- Example: Refund for unused days if student withdraws

- **Be consistent**: Use same method (QR or manual) throughout term
- **Add notes**: Brief notes help track patterns (e.g., "Sick", "Family emergency")
- **Follow up**: Contact parents if student absent >2 consecutive days

### For Administrators
- **Review daily**: Check daily summary every afternoon
- **Monitor trends**: Weekly analytics review (every Monday)
- **Intervene early**: Address <75% attendance immediately
- **Communicate**: Share attendance reports with teachers monthly

### For Parents
- **Check daily**: Login to parent portal to verify attendance
- **Report absences**: Inform school in advance if child will be absent
- **Submit notes**: Upload doctor's notes for excused absences
- **Respond quickly**: Reply to absence alerts within 24 hours

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Attendance not saving
**Possible Causes**:
- Network timeout (retry)
- Duplicate record (student already marked for this date)
- Invalid date (cannot mark attendance for future dates)

**Solution**:
- Check date selector (must be today or past)
- Refresh page and try again
- Check browser console for errors

---

### Issue: QR code not working
**Possible Causes**:
- QR code expired (>5 minutes old)
- Student not enrolled in selected class
- Student already checked in

**Solution**:
- Generate new QR code
- Verify student enrolled in class
- Check attendance list (student may be already present)

---

### Issue: Parent not receiving absence alerts
**Possible Causes**:
- Email incorrect in guardian profile
- Notifications disabled in settings
- Email in spam folder

**Solution**:
- Verify parent email in student profile
- Check Settings → Notifications (ensure absence alerts enabled)
- Ask parent to check spam/junk folder
- Add `noreply@databayt.org` to contacts

---

### Issue: Cannot correct old attendance
**Possible Causes**:
- Correction window expired (>7 days for teachers)
- User lacks permission (must be admin)

**Solution**:
- Teachers: Request admin to make correction
