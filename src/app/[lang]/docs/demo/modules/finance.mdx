2. Weekly Total: 37.75 hours
3. Overtime: 1.75 hours × 1.5 rate = 2.625 hours paid

**Overtime Calculation**:
- Regular hours: 40 hours /week (salary covers this)
- Overtime rate: 1.5× (time-and-a-half)
- Example: Teacher works 45 hours → 5 hours overtime

**Leave Tracking**:
- Sick Leave: 10 days /year (paid)
- Annual Leave: 20 days /year (paid)
- Unpaid Leave: Deducted from salary
- Example: Teacher takes 3 unpaid leave days
  - Daily rate: SDG 1,600 ÷ 22 working days = SDG 72.73 /day
  - Deduction: 3 days × SDG 72.73 = SDG 218.19
