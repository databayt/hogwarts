### Best Practices for Auto-Marking

**DO**:
- Use auto-marking for objective, fact-based questions
- Provide clear, unambiguous answer options
- Include explanations for incorrect answers
- Review auto-graded results periodically for anomalies
- Set multiple accepted answers for fill-in-the-blank
- Use rubrics for manual grading consistency

**DON'T**:
- Rely solely on auto-marking (mix with subjective questions)
- Show correct answers immediately (reduces learning)
- Skip manual review of flagged questions
- Use vague or ambiguous question wording
- Penalize students for minor spelling variations
- Ignore student feedback about incorrect auto-grades

Time Analysis:
Average Completion Time: 25 minutes (allotted: 30 min)
Fastest: 15 minutes (Ahmed - 96%)
Slowest: 30 minutes (Hassan - 50%)
