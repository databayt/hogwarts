## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Login Issues**

**Problem**: "Invalid email or password"
- **Solution**: Verify you're using the correct email format:
  - Admin: `admin@demo.school` (NOT `admin@demo.databayt.org`)
  - All passwords: `1234`
  - Ensure no extra spaces in email/password

**Problem**: "School not found" or "Invalid subdomain"
- **Solution**:
  - Correct URL: `https://demo.ed.databayt.org`
  - Subdomain must be: `demo`
  - Do not use: `http://` (must be `https://`)

**Problem**: "Session expired" or logged out unexpectedly
- **Solution**:
  - Clear browser cookies for `ed.databayt.org`
  - Log in again
  - Session timeout: 24 hours

---

#### **Data Issues**

**Problem**: "No data found" or empty tables
- **Solution**:
  - Verify demo was seeded: Check [Demo Data Overview](#-demo-data-overview) section
  - Run seed command: `pnpm db:seed` (for local setup)
  - Contact admin if on hosted demo

**Problem**: "Student/teacher not found"
- **Solution**:
  - Use email format from credentials section above
  - Student emails: `{firstname}.{lastname}.{number}@demo.school`
  - Check: Are you logged in with correct role? (e.g., teachers can only see their classes)

**Problem**: Data seems outdated or missing
- **Solution**:
  - Demo data resets monthly (first Monday)
  - Check reset date
  - If just reset, data will be fresh

---

#### **Module-Specific Issues**

**Attendance**:
- **Problem**: Cannot mark attendance
  - **Solution**: Verify you're a teacher assigned to that class, check if attendance already marked for today
- **Problem**: QR code not scanning
  - **Solution**: Ensure camera permissions enabled, use mobile device, check lighting

**Exams**:
- **Problem**: Cannot see exam results
  - **Solution**: Teacher must publish results first, check exam status (draft vs published)

  - **Solution**: Book may be reserved for class/course, contact librarian

**LMS**:
- **Problem**: Cannot access paid course after payment
  - **Solution**: Payment confirmation may take time, contact admin to manually enroll
- **Problem**: Lesson video won't play
  - **Solution**: Check video URL, ensure valid YouTube/Vimeo link, check internet connection

  - **Solution**: Enable cookies, refresh page, log out and back in

**Communication**:
- **Problem**: Announcement not received by students
  - **Solution**: Check scope (school vs class vs individual), verify student email settings

  - **Solution**: Demo environment simulates emails (not sent), check in-app notifications instead
