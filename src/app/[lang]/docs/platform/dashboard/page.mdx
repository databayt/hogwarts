## Data Architecture

### Server Components
Dashboard uses server-side rendering for initial data load:

```typescript
export async function DashboardContent({ role, userId }) {
  const dashboardData = await getDashboardDataByRole(role, userId);
  return <DashboardLayout data={dashboardData} />;
}
```

### Role-Based Queries
Efficient database queries based on user role:

```typescript
async function getAdminDashboard(schoolId) {
  return {
    stats: await getSchoolStatistics(schoolId),
    tasks: await getPendingTasks(schoolId),
    activities: await getRecentActivities(schoolId)
  };
}
```

### Real-Time Updates
WebSocket connections for live data:

- Attendance updates
- New announcements
- Grade publications
- System alerts

## Performance Optimization

### Data Loading Strategy
- Initial server-side render
- Progressive enhancement
- Lazy loading for charts
- Cached frequent queries

### Query Optimization
- Role-specific data fetching
- Indexed database fields
- Pagination for lists
- Aggregated statistics

### Client-Side Caching
- Session storage for static data
- React Query for API calls
- Optimistic UI updates
- Background data refresh
