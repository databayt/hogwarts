## Access Control

The Operator dashboard is restricted to platform administrators with the following roles:

- **Super Admin**: Full platform control
- **Support Admin**: Tenant support and management
- **Billing Admin**: Financial operations
- **Read-Only Admin**: Monitoring and reporting

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
The operator module uses a separate schema for platform-level data:

- `tenants` - Tenant configurations
- `subscriptions` - Billing subscriptions
- `invoices` - Generated invoices
- `platform_users` - Platform administrators
- `audit_logs` - System audit trail

### API Endpoints
RESTful API for operator functions:

- `/api/operator/tenants` - Tenant CRUD operations
- `/api/operator/billing` - Billing management
- `/api/operator/analytics` - Analytics data
- `/api/operator/monitoring` - System metrics

### Security Measures

- Two-factor authentication required
- IP whitelist for admin access
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Encrypted sensitive data
- Regular security audits

## Deployment

The operator module can be deployed:

- As part of the main application
- As a separate microservice
- In a different region for compliance

## Configuration

Key environment variables:

```env
OPERATOR_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@platform.com
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
MONITORING_API_KEY=xxx
ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID=xxx
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**: Daily automated backups of platform data
2. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for critical metrics
3. **Access Control**: Regularly review admin access
4. **Audit Logs**: Monitor for suspicious activity
5. **Performance**: Optimize database queries for scale
