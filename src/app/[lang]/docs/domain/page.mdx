## Domain & Subdomain — Multi‑tenant guide

This page explains how tenant routing works via subdomains, how the `schoolId` is resolved on the server, and how to scope all database reads/writes per tenant. It also includes local‑dev tips without real subdomains.

### Explain it like I'm five (ELI5)

- Think of the website like a big city (the root domain).
- Each school is a different house on its own street (the subdomain), like `demo.databayt.org`.
- When you walk into a house, you only see that family's stuff. In our app, when you go to a school's subdomain, you only see that school's data.
- The "key" we use to make sure we only look at the right family's stuff is called `schoolId`.

### TL;DR — Quick test (dev + prod)

- Dev (no subdomains): add `?x-school=demo` to any page, e.g. `/dashboard?x-school=demo`.
- Dev (with local subdomains): set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN=localhost` and visit `http://demo.localhost:3000/dashboard`.
- Prod: visit the subdomain directly, e.g., `https://demo.databayt.org/dashboard`.
- Role‑gated pages: ensure your user role (e.g., `ADMIN`) is set. See "Set my role for testing".

### Concepts

- **Root domain**: Your main host, e.g., `databayt.org` (set via `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN`).
- **Subdomain (tenant slug)**: The school's unique domain slug stored on the `School` model as `domain` (e.g., `demo`). Full host example: `demo.databayt.org`.
- **Tenant identity**: All data is partitioned by `schoolId`. Every query/mutation must include `{ schoolId }`.

### Data model

```ts
// prisma/models/school.prisma
model School {
  id      String @id @default(cuid())
  name    String
  domain  String @unique // e.g. "khartoum" for khartoum.hogwarts.app
  // ...other fields
}
```

### Request flow (overview)

1) A user visits a host. In middleware, we extract the subdomain and propagate it in a header.

```ts
// src/middleware.ts (excerpt)
const host = nextUrl.hostname
const rootDomain = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN // e.g. "hogwarts.app"
let subdomain: string | null = null

const devDomainParam = nextUrl.searchParams.get("x-school")
if (devDomainParam) {
  subdomain = devDomainParam
} else if (rootDomain && host.endsWith("." + rootDomain)) {
  subdomain = host.slice(0, -(rootDomain.length + 1)) || null
}

if (subdomain) {
  const requestHeaders = new Headers(req.headers)
  requestHeaders.set("x-subdomain", subdomain)
  return Response.next({ request: { headers: requestHeaders } })
}
```

2) On the server, we resolve `schoolId` using the injected header (or impersonation cookie, or session fallback).

```ts
// src/components/platform/operator/lib/tenant.ts (excerpt)
export async function getTenantContext() {
  const session = await auth()
  const cookieStore = await cookies()
  const hdrs = await headers()

  const impersonatedSchoolId = cookieStore.get("impersonate_schoolId")?.value ?? null

  let headerSchoolId: string | null = null
  const subdomain = hdrs.get("x-subdomain")
  if (subdomain) {
    const school = await db.school.findUnique({ where: { domain: subdomain } })
    headerSchoolId = school?.id ?? null
  }

  const schoolId = impersonatedSchoolId ?? headerSchoolId ?? session?.user?.schoolId ?? null
  const role = (session?.user?.role as UserRole | undefined) ?? null
  const isPlatformAdmin = role === "DEVELOPER"
  const requestId = null
  return { schoolId, requestId, role, isPlatformAdmin }
}
```

3) All server actions and DB access must include `{ schoolId }`.

```ts
// Example usage in a server action
import { getTenantContext } from "@/components/platform/operator/lib/tenant"
import { db } from "@/lib/db"

export async function listStudents() {
  const { schoolId } = await getTenantContext()
  if (!schoolId) throw new Error("Missing tenant context")
  return db.student.findMany({ where: { schoolId } })
}
```

### Why a header instead of DB calls in middleware?

Next.js middleware can’t safely perform dynamic DB queries in all environments. We extract the subdomain in middleware, add it as `x-subdomain`, and resolve to `schoolId` later on the server where DB access is allowed.

### Local development without real subdomains

You have two convenient options while developing on `localhost`:

- Add `?x-school=<domain>` to any URL to simulate a tenant. Example: `/dashboard?x-school=khartoum`.
- For public, unauthenticated APIs that support fallback, pass `?domain=<domain>`.
  - See Timetable docs for examples:
    - Terms: `GET /api/terms?domain=demo`
    - Timetable: `GET /api/timetable?domain=demo&weekOffset=0`

Seeded demo domain: `demo` (fully-featured demo school with 150 students, 25 teachers). Other examples like `portsudan`, `khartoum` can be seeded as needed.

### Hands‑on: interactive debug page

- Visit `/operator/tenant-debug` in the app to see the current tenant and live counts for students/teachers/classes.
- In development: click a school card to reload with `?x-school=<domain>` and watch the counts change instantly.
- In production: navigate to the school's subdomain (e.g., `demo.databayt.org/operator/tenant-debug`).
- If you see "No active tenant detected", either add `?x-school=<domain>` in dev or switch to the correct subdomain in prod.

### Simple: set my school for testing

Pick one of these:

1) Easiest (URL param): add `?x-school=<domain>` to the page you're testing.
   - Example: `/dashboard?x-school=demo`.

2) Correct (user is tied to a school): set your user's `schoolId` to match a school.
   - Using Prisma Studio:
     1. Run: `pnpm dlx prisma studio`
     2. Open `School` table, copy the `id` of the row where `domain = "demo"`.
     3. Open `User` table, set your `schoolId` to that `id` and save.

3) Operator (DEVELOPER only): start impersonation which sets a cookie overriding the tenant.
   - The action `startImpersonation(schoolId)` sets an `impersonate_schoolId` cookie for ~30 minutes.
   - A banner appears with “Stop impersonation” to clear it.

### Environment

Set your root domain to enable subdomain parsing in middleware.

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN=databayt.org
```

For the Databayt platform, the root domain is `databayt.org`. The marketing site is at `ed.databayt.org`, and schools use `*.databayt.org` (e.g., `demo.databayt.org`).

In local development, to use subdomains like `demo.localhost:3000`, set:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN=localhost
```

### Set my role for testing

Pages and actions are often role‑gated (e.g., Admin‑only). Make your test user an `ADMIN` or `DEVELOPER`:

- Using Prisma Studio:
  1. `pnpm dlx prisma studio`
  2. Open `User` table
  3. Set `role` to one of: `DEVELOPER`, `ADMIN`, `TEACHER`, `STUDENT`, `GUARDIAN`, `ACCOUNTANT`, `STAFF`, `USER`
  4. Save

- Using SQL (example):

```sql
-- Make the user a developer
UPDATE users SET role = 'DEVELOPER' WHERE email = 'me@example.com';

-- Tie the user to the demo school
UPDATE users
SET schoolId = (SELECT id FROM schools WHERE domain = 'demo')
WHERE email = 'me@example.com';
```

### Auth session and tenant fallback

Auth attaches `schoolId` to the JWT/session. If a request lacks `x-subdomain` and impersonation cookie, `getTenantContext()` falls back to `session.user.schoolId`.

```ts
// src/auth.ts (excerpt – JWT callback)
;(token as unknown as { schoolId?: string | null }).schoolId = existingUser.schoolId ?? null
```

### Impersonation (operator/dev only)

Operator tools can set an `impersonate_schoolId` cookie to override the current tenant. This is resolved first in `getTenantContext()`.

### Guardrails (must‑do)

- Always scope Prisma queries and mutations with `{ schoolId }`.
- Keep unique constraints scoped by `schoolId` where applicable.
- Never rely on client state for tenant identity; the server is the source of truth.

```ts
// prisma/README.md (principle)
// ✅ Correct – Always include schoolId
await prisma.student.findMany({ where: { schoolId } })
```

### Verifying your setup

1) Visit `/docs` (public) to ensure middleware doesn’t block docs.
2) Open the debug page: `/(platform)/operator/tenant-debug`.
3) In dev, click a school card (adds `?x-school=<domain>`); in prod, move between subdomains.
4) Confirm the counts change as you switch tenants.
5) Navigate to `/students` and `/teachers` with the same `?x-school=<domain>` in dev or under the subdomain in prod.

### Troubleshooting

- Missing tenant: ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN` is set correctly and a `School` row exists with `domain` matching the subdomain.
- Local dev without subdomain: use `?x-school=<domain>` or the public API `?domain=<domain>` fallbacks.
- Session fallback is null: sign in a user that has `schoolId` or specify `x-school`.
