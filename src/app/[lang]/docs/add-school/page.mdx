## Add a School

Step-by-step guide to provision a new tenant (school) with a unique subdomain and default settings.

### Prerequisites

- Platform admin access or self-serve signup enabled
- School name, preferred subdomain, admin email

### Steps

1. Start: click "Create School"
2. Enter details: name, subdomain (e.g., `schoolname` → `schoolname.databayt.org`), timezone
3. Choose plan: Trial, Basic, Pro
4. Invite users: Owner/Admin, Teachers (optional)
5. Seed data: example classes and subjects (optional)
6. Finish: you’ll land in the School Dashboard at the new subdomain

### Invite & Roles

- Owner: full control including billing and domain
- Admin: manage users, classes, subjects, announcements
- Teacher: mark attendance and view timetable
- Parent/Student: read-only portal (MVP)

### Domain & Branding

- Subdomain is created instantly
- Custom domain: submit a request; we provide DNS instructions (CNAME) and certificate automation
- Upload logo, set primary color, and landing page content

### Billing & Trial

- Trial starts immediately; countdown shown in dashboard
- Convert to paid plan anytime; invoices stored in Billing

### Access Control

- First invited user becomes Owner; can add Admins and other roles
- All data is scoped by `schoolId` automatically

### Automation (Optional)

- Seed script creates demo classes and subjects for evaluation
- Sample data can be purged from Settings once real data is ready

### Troubleshooting

- Subdomain taken: choose a different one or add `-school`
- Email not received: check spam, then re-send invite
- Custom domain pending: verify DNS propagation (may take up to 24 hours)

### FAQ

- Can I change subdomain later? Yes, with redirect; custom domain recommended for branding.
- Can I pause my subscription? Yes, school becomes read-only until reactivated.
