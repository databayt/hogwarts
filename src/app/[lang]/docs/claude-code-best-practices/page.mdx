# Claude Code Best Practices

Master proven workflows and techniques to maximize productivity and get the most out of Claude Code's agentic capabilities.

## Core Workflow: Explore → Plan → Code → Commit

The most effective Claude Code workflow follows a structured pattern that mirrors professional software development.

### 1. Explore Phase

Start by having Claude understand your codebase thoroughly before making changes.

```
You: "I need to add user authentication"

Claude: Let me explore your codebase first...
[Uses Glob to find auth-related files]
[Reads current auth implementation]
[Checks package.json for auth libraries]

Claude: I found you're using NextAuth v5. I'll build on that foundation.
```

**Best Practices**:
- Let Claude read relevant files before proposing solutions
- Ask exploratory questions: "What authentication system do we use?"
- Review Claude's findings before proceeding

### 2. Plan Phase

Have Claude create a detailed implementation plan before writing code.

```
You: "Create a plan for the authentication feature"

Claude: Here's my implementation plan:

1. Create auth middleware (src/middleware/auth.ts)
2. Add protected route wrapper
3. Update login/logout handlers
4. Add JWT token validation
5. Write integration tests
6. Update CLAUDE.md with auth patterns

Does this approach work for you?
```

**Best Practices**:
- Always review the plan before implementation
- Ask Claude to explain any unclear steps
- Request estimates for each phase
- Approve or adjust the plan explicitly

### 3. Code Phase

Execute the plan incrementally with verification at each step.

```
You: "Implement step 1"

Claude: [Creates auth middleware]
Claude: Middleware created. Running tests...
Claude: ✓ Tests pass. Ready for step 2?

You: "Proceed"
```

**Best Practices**:
- Implement one step at a time for complex features
- Run tests after each major change
- Review diffs before proceeding to next step
- Use `/clear` between unrelated features

### 4. Commit Phase

Let Claude handle git operations with meaningful commits.

```
You: "Create a commit for this feature"

Claude: [Reviews changes]
Claude: I'll create a commit with these changes:
- Added JWT authentication middleware
- Protected dashboard routes
- Added auth integration tests

[Creates commit with conventional commit format]
```

**Best Practices**:
- Review `git diff` before committing
- Use conventional commit format
- Let Claude write descriptive commit messages
- Commit small, logical units of work

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Claude excels at TDD workflows when guided properly.

### Write Tests First

```
You: "Create a User model with email validation using TDD"

Claude: I'll write the test first:
[Creates user.test.ts with failing tests]

Claude: Tests are failing as expected. Now implementing...
[Implements User model]

Claude: ✓ All tests passing!
```

### Test Coverage Verification

```
You: "Add tests for the edge cases we discussed"

Claude: [Adds additional test cases]
Claude: Coverage report:
- Statements: 98%
- Branches: 95%
- Functions: 100%
```

**Best Practices**:
- Explicitly request "TDD approach" for critical features
- Have Claude run tests before and after implementation
- Ask for coverage reports when needed
- Use tests as living documentation

## Visual Iteration

Claude can work with screenshots and designs to match implementation to mockups.

### Design to Code

```
You: [Drag and drop screenshot]
You: "Implement this design"

Claude: [Analyzes screenshot]
Claude: I see a two-column layout with a sidebar and main content area.
I'll create this using Tailwind Grid...
```

### Visual Verification Loop

```
Claude: [Implements component]
Claude: Please take a screenshot so I can verify the result matches the design.

You: [Shares screenshot]

Claude: The spacing looks off. Let me adjust the padding...
```

**Best Practices**:
- Share screenshots of designs before implementation
- Provide screenshots during iteration for adjustments
- Use annotations on screenshots for specific feedback
- Include design system documentation in CLAUDE.md

## Specificity in Instructions

Precise instructions yield better results faster.

### ❌ Vague Instructions

```
"Fix this code"
"Make it better"
"Clean up the UI"
"Improve performance"
```

### ✅ Specific Instructions

```
"Fix the TypeScript error in UserService.ts line 45"
"Refactor the UserList component to use React.memo"
"Update the dashboard layout to match the Figma design"
"Optimize the database query in getUsers() - it's causing N+1 queries"
```

### Provide Context

**Include**:
- Error messages (full stack traces)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Related files or components
- Recent changes that might be relevant
- Environment details (OS, Node version, etc.)

**Example**:

```
You: "The login form isn't working. When I submit, I get:
Error: Cannot read property 'email' of undefined
at LoginForm.tsx:45

Expected: Form should call loginAction with email and password
Actual: Getting undefined error

Recent changes: I just updated react-hook-form from v7.50 to v7.61

Environment: Node 20.11, Next.js 15.4.4"
```

## Visual Context

Leverage Claude's vision capabilities for better results.

### Screenshots

```
You: [Drag and drop error screenshot]
You: "What's causing this error?"

Claude: [Analyzes screenshot]
Claude: The error shows a hydration mismatch. This happens when...
```

### Diagrams

```
You: [Share architecture diagram]
You: "Implement this data flow"

Claude: I see the flow goes: Client → API → Service → Database
I'll implement each layer...
```

### Code in Images

```
You: [Screenshot of code from documentation]
You: "Implement this pattern in our codebase"

Claude: [Reads code from image]
Claude: I'll adapt this pattern to your TypeScript setup...
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use screenshots for visual bugs
- Share error dialogs directly
- Include network tab screenshots for API issues
- Annotate images with arrows/circles for clarity

## Course Correction Tools

Know when to reset and redirect Claude's approach.

### Use /clear Strategically

Clear context when:
- Starting a completely new feature
- Claude seems confused or stuck in wrong approach
- Switching to unrelated task
- After completing a major milestone

```bash
/clear
```

**Don't clear when**:
- Making small iterations on current task
- Claude is mid-implementation
- Building on previous context

### Redirect with Explicit Feedback

```
You: "Stop. This approach won't work because we're using PostgreSQL, not MongoDB"

Claude: You're right, let me revise...
```

### Ask for Alternative Approaches

```
You: "What are 3 different ways we could implement caching here?"

Claude: Here are three approaches:
1. Redis with TTL...
2. In-memory LRU cache...
3. Database-level caching...
```

## Checklists for Consistency

Provide checklists for repetitive tasks to ensure consistency.

### In CLAUDE.md

```markdown
## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing, always:
- [ ] Run `pnpm test`
- [ ] Run `pnpm lint`
- [ ] Check `git diff` for debug statements
- [ ] Verify no `console.log` in production code
- [ ] Update relevant tests
- [ ] Run `pnpm build` to verify no build errors
```

### In Prompts

```
You: "Add the new API endpoint and run through the checklist:
1. Add TypeScript types
2. Add Zod validation
3. Add error handling
4. Add unit tests
5. Update OpenAPI docs
6. Test with Postman"
```

**Best Practices**:
- Create checklists for common workflows
- Reference checklists in CLAUDE.md
- Have Claude confirm completion of each item
- Update checklists based on lessons learned

## Git Integration Best Practices

### Meaningful Commit Messages

```
You: "Create a commit following conventional commits"

Claude: git commit -m "feat(auth): Add JWT authentication middleware

- Implement token validation
- Add protected route wrapper
- Include unit tests for auth flow
- Update docs with auth setup

Closes #123"
```

### Atomic Commits

```
You: "Create separate commits for:
1. The bug fix
2. The refactoring
3. The new tests"

Claude: [Creates three focused commits]
```

### Pre-Commit Verification

```
You: "Before committing, verify:
- Tests pass
- Linting passes
- Build succeeds
- No sensitive data in changes"

Claude: [Runs all checks]
Claude: ✓ All checks passed. Creating commit...
```

### Branch Management

```
You: "Create a feature branch and commit these changes"

Claude: git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
[Makes commits]
Claude: Ready to push to remote?
```

**Best Practices**:
- Let Claude generate descriptive commit messages
- Review `git diff` before approving commits
- Use conventional commit format
- Keep commits focused and atomic

## Headless Mode for Automation

Use headless mode for scripted or automated workflows.

### Single Task Execution

```bash
claude -p "Run tests and create a commit if they pass"
```

### CI/CD Integration

```bash
# In GitHub Actions
- name: AI Code Review
  run: |
    claude -p "Review the changes in this PR and comment on potential issues"
```

### Batch Operations

```bash
claude -p "Update all components to use the new Button API"
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use `-p` flag for one-off tasks
- Redirect output for logging: `> claude-output.log`
- Set explicit permissions in CI with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- Keep prompts self-contained and specific

## Multi-Claude Workflows

Use multiple Claude instances for complex projects.

### Parallel Development

**Terminal 1 - Feature Development**:
```bash
cd ~/project
git checkout feature/auth
claude
```

**Terminal 2 - Code Review**:
```bash
cd ~/project
git checkout main
claude /agents/code-reviewer
```

### Separation of Concerns

**Terminal 1 - Backend**:
```bash
cd ~/project/api
claude
> "Implement the API endpoints"
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend**:
```bash
cd ~/project/web
claude
> "Create the React components"
```

### Git Worktrees

```bash
# Main development
git worktree add ../project-feature feature/auth
cd ../project-feature
claude

# Parallel bug fix
git worktree add ../project-hotfix hotfix/login-error
cd ../project-hotfix
claude
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use worktrees for parallel git contexts
- Keep instances focused on specific domains
- Use `/clear` to prevent context bleeding
- Share findings between instances via commits

## Incremental Refinement

Build features iteratively rather than all at once.

### Start Simple

```
You: "Create a basic user list component"
Claude: [Creates simple component]

You: "Add search functionality"
Claude: [Adds search]

You: "Add pagination"
Claude: [Adds pagination]

You: "Add sorting by column"
Claude: [Adds sorting]
```

### Progressive Enhancement

```
You: "Create the feature with these priorities:
1. Core functionality (MVP)
2. Error handling
3. Loading states
4. Optimistic updates
5. Animations
Let's do one at a time."
```

**Best Practices**:
- Build minimum viable version first
- Test each increment
- Add complexity gradually
- Easier to debug small changes

## Learning from Sessions

Improve your CLAUDE.md based on interactions.

### Press # During Sessions

```
# During conversation
[Press #]

Claude: Based on our conversation, I suggest adding to CLAUDE.md:

## Testing Pattern
- Always use Vitest, not Jest
- Mock API calls with MSW
- Place tests next to source files

Add this?
```

### Session Review

```
You: "What should we add to CLAUDE.md based on this session?"

Claude: We discovered:
1. The API requires authentication header
2. Database queries must include schoolId
3. Forms need both client and server validation

I'll update CLAUDE.md with these patterns.
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use `#` key regularly during sessions
- Review CLAUDE.md weekly
- Commit CLAUDE.md changes
- Share updates with team

## Common Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Too Much at Once

```
You: "Create the entire auth system, payment integration, admin dashboard, and email notifications"
```

**Better**: Break into separate sessions or step-by-step prompts.

### ❌ Insufficient Context

```
You: "Fix the bug"
[No error message, no file path, no description]
```

**Better**: Include error, location, expected behavior, and what you've tried.

### ❌ Over-Reliance Without Review

```
You: "Implement this feature"
Claude: [Makes 50 file changes]
You: "Commit it"
[Never reviews the changes]
```

**Better**: Review diffs, run tests, verify behavior before committing.

### ❌ Fighting Claude's Approach

```
Claude: "I'll use approach A because..."
You: "No, use approach B"
Claude: [Uses approach B]
You: "Actually, why not approach C?"
```

**Better**: Explain your requirements upfront or ask Claude to compare approaches.

## Performance Tips

### Optimize Context Window

```
# Clear between unrelated tasks
/clear

# Start fresh for new features
You: "Starting new feature. Previous context not needed."
```

### Use Targeted File Reading

```
You: "Only read the authentication files, ignore the rest of the codebase"
```

### Batch Related Changes

```
You: "Update all 10 components to use the new API in one go"
```

### Use Faster Models for Simple Tasks

```
# Simple refactoring
/model
[Select Haiku]

You: "Rename this function across the codebase"
```

## Debugging with Claude

### Systematic Debugging

```
You: "Debug this error systematically:
1. Read the error trace
2. Find the source file
3. Identify the root cause
4. Suggest 3 potential fixes
5. Implement the best fix"
```

### Rubber Duck Debugging

```
You: "Explain this code to me line by line"

Claude: [Explains code]
Claude: Wait, I see the issue on line 15...
```

### Comparative Debugging

```
You: "Compare the working version (commit abc123) with current broken version"

Claude: [Compares files]
Claude: The regression was introduced when...
```
