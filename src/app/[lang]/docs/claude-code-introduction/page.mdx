# Claude Code Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for Claude Code - Anthropic's agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and transforms how you write code.

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an AI-powered development assistant that understands your codebase, executes routine tasks, explains complex code, and handles git workflows through natural language commands. It combines the intelligence of Claude with specialized tools designed for software development.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Code Understanding
Claude Code analyzes your entire codebase, understanding context, patterns, and relationships between files. It can:
- Navigate complex codebases with ease
- Understand project structure and dependencies
- Maintain context across multiple files
- Follow your coding conventions and patterns

### Natural Language Interface
Communicate with Claude using everyday language:
- "Implement the feature described in issue #123"
- "Refactor this component to use React hooks"
- "Find and fix all TypeScript type errors"
- "Create a PR with these changes"

### Agentic Task Execution
Unlike simple code completion, Claude Code can:
- Plan complex multi-step tasks
- Execute commands and scripts
- Make code changes across multiple files
- Run tests and verify implementations
- Create commits and pull requests

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows (WSL recommended)
- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher
- **Git**: Version 2.x or higher
- **Anthropic API Key**: Get one at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

### Install via npm

```bash
npm install -g claude-code
```

### Install via Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install claude-code
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
claude --version
```

## First Time Setup

### 1. Authenticate

Run Claude Code for the first time:

```bash
claude
```

You'll be prompted to enter your Anthropic API key. Alternatively, set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 2. Initialize Project

Navigate to your project directory and initialize:

```bash
cd your-project
claude /init
```

This creates a `.claude/` directory with default configuration and a `CLAUDE.md` file documenting your project for Claude.

### 3. Configure Permissions

Claude Code respects your system by requesting permission before modifying files. Configure allowed tools:

```bash
claude /permissions
```

Common permissions to allow:
- `Edit` - File modifications
- `Write` - Creating new files
- `Bash(git:*)` - All git operations
- `Bash(npm:*)` - Package management

## Basic Usage

### Start a Session

```bash
claude
```

This opens an interactive terminal session where you can chat with Claude.

### Run Single Command

```bash
claude -p "Add error handling to the login function"
```

The `-p` flag runs a single prompt in headless mode.

### Interactive Mode

In interactive mode, you can:
- Type naturally: "Find all TODO comments in the codebase"
- Use `/` commands: `/help`, `/clear`, `/model`
- Press `Esc` to interrupt Claude
- Double-tap `Esc` to edit previous prompts

## Core Concepts

### Context Window
Claude Code maintains conversation history and file context. Use `/clear` to reset when starting new tasks.

### Tools
Claude has access to specialized tools:
- **Read/Write/Edit**: File operations
- **Glob/Grep**: File search and content search
- **Bash**: Execute shell commands
- **Task**: Launch specialized subagents

### Models
Switch between Claude models based on your needs:
- **Sonnet (default)**: Balanced performance and cost
- **Opus**: Maximum intelligence for complex tasks
- **Haiku**: Fast responses for simple tasks

Use `/model` to switch models during a session.

## Workflow Patterns

### Explore → Plan → Code → Verify

```
You: "Add authentication to the API"

Claude: Let me first explore your codebase...
[Reads relevant files]

Claude: Here's my plan:
1. Create auth middleware
2. Add JWT token generation
3. Protect routes
4. Add tests

You: "Looks good, proceed"

Claude: [Implements the plan step by step]
```

### Test-Driven Development

```
You: "Create a User model with validation"

Claude: I'll write tests first...
[Creates test file]

Claude: Tests are failing as expected. Now implementing...
[Implements the feature]

Claude: All tests passing!
```

## Best Practices

### Be Specific
❌ "Fix this code"
✅ "Fix the TypeScript type error in `UserService.ts` line 45"

### Provide Context
Include relevant information:
- Error messages
- Expected behavior
- Related files or components
- Screenshots (drag and drop)

### Iterate Incrementally
Break large tasks into smaller steps:
1. "First, create the database schema"
2. "Now add the API endpoints"
3. "Finally, add frontend components"

### Use CLAUDE.md
Document project-specific information in `CLAUDE.md`:
- Coding standards
- Testing conventions
- Common commands
- Deployment procedures
