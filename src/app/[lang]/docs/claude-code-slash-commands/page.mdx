# Claude Code Slash Commands

Extend Claude Code's capabilities with custom commands that automate workflows, enforce standards, and boost productivity through simple shortcuts.

## What Are Slash Commands?

Slash commands are custom shortcuts that expand into prompts when invoked. They let you:
- Automate repetitive workflows
- Enforce coding standards
- Create project-specific helpers
- Build team-wide utilities
- Chain complex operations

### Built-in Commands

Claude Code includes several built-in commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands and usage |
| `/clear` | Reset conversation context |
| `/model` | Switch between Claude models |
| `/permissions` | Manage tool permissions |
| `/init` | Initialize project with `.claude/` config |
| `/mcp` | Manage MCP server connections |
| `/plugin` | Install and manage plugins |

## Creating Custom Slash Commands

### File Location

Custom commands live in `.claude/commands/` directory:

```
your-project/
  .claude/
    commands/
      review-pr.md          # /review-pr
      deploy-staging.md     # /deploy-staging
      add-component.md      # /add-component
```

### Basic Command Structure

Create `.claude/commands/hello.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Say hello to the user
---

Say "Hello! How can I help you today?" in a friendly tone.
```

Usage:
```bash
/hello
```

Expands to:
```
Say "Hello! How can I help you today?" in a friendly tone.
```

### Command with Frontmatter

The YAML frontmatter defines metadata:

```markdown
---
description: Review a pull request for code quality
requiresArgs: true
---

Review pull request for:
- Code quality and best practices
- Potential bugs
- Security issues
- Performance concerns
- Test coverage
```

**Frontmatter Fields**:
- `description` (string): Shown in `/help` output
- `requiresArgs` (boolean): Whether command needs arguments
- `aliases` (array): Alternative command names

## Arguments and Variables

### $ARGUMENTS - Full Argument String

```markdown
---
description: Create a React component
---

Create a new React component named $ARGUMENTS with:
- TypeScript definitions
- Prop interface
- Default export
- Basic styling with Tailwind
```

Usage:
```bash
/add-component UserProfile
```

Expands to:
```
Create a new React component named UserProfile with:
- TypeScript definitions
- Prop interface
- Default export
- Basic styling with Tailwind
```

### $1, $2, $3 - Positional Arguments

```markdown
---
description: Create API endpoint with method and path
---

Create a new API endpoint:
- Method: $1
- Path: $2
- Add TypeScript types
- Add Zod validation
- Add error handling
- Write integration tests
```

Usage:
```bash
/api-endpoint POST /users
```

Expands to:
```
Create a new API endpoint:
- Method: POST
- Path: /users
...
```

### Multiple Arguments Example

```markdown
---
description: Deploy to environment with version
---

Deploy version $1 to $2 environment:

1. Run pre-deployment checks
2. Build production bundle
3. Run migrations if needed
4. Deploy to $2
5. Run smoke tests
6. Tag release as $1
```

Usage:
```bash
/deploy v2.1.0 staging
```

## File References with @

Reference files in command prompts using `@`:

```markdown
---
description: Refactor component to use new pattern
---

Refactor the component at @$1 to follow the pattern in @docs/patterns/component-pattern.md

Ensure:
- All props are typed
- Hooks are used correctly
- Styling matches design system
```

Usage:
```bash
/refactor-component src/components/UserList.tsx
```

Claude will read both files before executing the prompt.

## Bash Execution with !

Execute bash commands inline with `!`:

```markdown
---
description: Run full test suite and create coverage report
---

!npm test -- --coverage

Analyze the test coverage report and:
1. Identify untested code paths
2. Suggest tests for critical uncovered code
3. Create test files for any uncovered components
```

**Inline Bash Features**:
- Commands run before prompt expansion
- Output is included in context
- Use for pre-flight checks
- Chain with `&&` for sequences

### Complex Bash Example

```markdown
---
description: PR readiness check
---

!git status
!git diff --stat
!npm test
!npm run lint

Based on the output above:
1. Verify all tests pass
2. Check for uncommitted changes
3. Ensure no linting errors
4. Create a summary of changes
5. Suggest commit message
```

## Real-World Command Examples

### Code Review Command

`.claude/commands/review-pr.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Comprehensive PR review for pull request number
requiresArgs: true
---

Review pull request #$1:

!gh pr view $1
!gh pr diff $1

Analyze:
1. **Code Quality**: Check for best practices, patterns, DRY violations
2. **Security**: Look for vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, injection risks
3. **Performance**: Identify potential bottlenecks, N+1 queries, memory leaks
4. **Tests**: Verify test coverage, test quality, edge cases
5. **Documentation**: Check if docs are updated, comments are clear
6. **Breaking Changes**: Identify any API changes that break compatibility

Provide:
- Summary of findings
- Critical issues (must fix)
- Suggestions (nice to have)
- Praise for good implementations
```

Usage:
```bash

   - `index.tsx` - Component implementation
   - `types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
   - `$1.test.tsx` - Vitest tests
   - `$1.stories.tsx` - Storybook stories (if Storybook is installed)

Component requirements:
- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Export Props interface
- Include JSDoc comments
- Use Tailwind for styling
- Default export component
- Named export for Props type

Test requirements:
- Render test
- Props test

```

## Namespacing Commands

Organize commands with directories:

```
.claude/
  commands/
    git/
      commit.md         # /git/commit
      pr.md            # /git/pr
      sync.md          # /git/sync
    test/
      unit.md          # /test/unit
      e2e.md           # /test/e2e
      coverage.md      # /test/coverage
    deploy/
      staging.md       # /deploy/staging
      production.md    # /deploy/production
```

**Benefits**:
- Logical organization
- Avoid name conflicts
- Team-specific namespaces
- Clear command hierarchy

## SlashCommand Tool

Commands can invoke other slash commands programmatically using the `SlashCommand` tool.

### Chaining Commands

`.claude/commands/full-check.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Run complete pre-commit check
---

Running full pre-commit verification:

1. First, run tests:
[Invoke /test/unit]

2. Check code quality:
[Invoke /lint]

3. Verify build:
[Invoke /build]

4. If all pass, ready to commit!
```

### Conditional Command Execution

```markdown
---
description: Smart deployment based on branch
---

!git branch --show-current

Based on the current branch:
- If 'main': [Invoke /deploy/production]
- If 'staging': [Invoke /deploy/staging]
- If 'develop': [Invoke /deploy/dev]
- Otherwise: Error - unknown branch
```

## Command Best Practices

### Make Commands Self-Documenting

```markdown
---
description: Add new database model with full setup
requiresArgs: true
---

# Creating new Prisma model: $1

This command will:
1. Add model to schema.prisma
2. Generate migration
3. Update Prisma client
4. Create TypeScript types
5. Add CRUD operations
6. Generate tests

Proceed? [Waiting for confirmation]
```

### Include Validation

```markdown
---
description: Deploy to production (requires confirmation)
---

⚠️  PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

!git branch --show-current
!git status

Pre-flight checks:
- Current branch must be 'main'
- Working directory must be clean
- All tests must pass

Type 'CONFIRM PRODUCTION DEPLOY' to proceed.
```

### Provide Context

```markdown
---
description: Fix common TypeScript errors
---

Reading TypeScript compiler output...
!npx tsc --noEmit

I'll fix these common patterns:
- Missing return types
- Implicit any types
- Unused variables
- Strict null checks

Reference @CLAUDE.md section "TypeScript Standards" for patterns.
```

### Error Handling

```markdown
---
description: Safe database reset
---

⚠️  This will delete all data!

!echo "Type 'DELETE ALL DATA' to confirm:"

[Wait for confirmation]

!npm run db:reset
!npm run db:seed

Database reset complete. Verify with test query.
```
