## Founder Dashboard

This dashboard is for the SaaS founder/operator. It aggregates across all schools by default and supports tenant drill-downs.

### Routes
- `/dashboard` → redirects to `/dashboard/overview`
- `/dashboard/overview` → KPIs across all schools (total schools, active schools, users, students)
- `/dashboard/kanban` → Kanban demo for task management
- `/dashboard/product` → Product page (tables temporarily disabled)
- `/dashboard/profile` → Profile
- `/dashboard/tenants` → Tenants list (temporarily public for build/demo; will be DEVELOPER-only)

### Operator (Platform) Routes
- `/operator` → redirects to `/operator/overview`
- `/operator/overview` → Founder/operator KPIs across all tenants
- `/operator/tenants` → Manage tenants (activate/suspend, impersonate)
- `/operator/domains` → Domain requests and verification (placeholder)
- `/operator/billing` → Operator billing overview (placeholder)
- `/operator/observability` → Logs/errors/backups/jobs (placeholder)
- Access control: DEVELOPER only. Guarded by middleware and operator layout.
  - Note: Temporarily disabled for public demo; guards are commented in `src/middleware.ts` and `src/app/(platform)/operator/layout.tsx`. Re-enable by uncommenting.

### Sidebar
The dashboard uses a docs-like template sidebar:

- Sidebar component: `src/components/template/dashboard-sidebar/content.tsx`
- Sidebar items: `src/components/template/dashboard-sidebar/config.ts`
- Header: `src/components/template/dashboard-header/content.tsx` (Breadcrumbs, notifications, messages, theme, user)

### Auth and Tenant
- Uses Auth.js (NextAuth v5). Session extended in `src/auth.ts` with `schoolId`, `role`, and flags.
- `src/lib/tenant.ts` provides `getTenantContext()` returning `{ schoolId, role, isPlatformAdmin, requestId }`.
- Middleware protects `/dashboard/**`; `/docs/**` public.
  - Operator guard: intended to restrict `/operator/**` to DEVELOPER via middleware; unauthorized redirects to `/403`.
  - Temporary: guard disabled for demo; see commented code in middleware and layout.

### KPIs (Overview)
`src/app/(platform)/dashboard/overview/layout.tsx` reads counts via Prisma (client dashboard):
- `db.school.count()` (total and active)
- `db.user.count()`
- `db.student.count()`

Operator overview KPIs:
- `src/app/(platform)/operator/overview/layout.tsx` aggregates the same KPIs across all tenants.

### Tables
- Shared block: `src/components/table/*` (DataTable, toolbar, filters, pagination)
- Tenants table: `src/app/(platform)/dashboard/tenants/page.tsx`
  - Columns: `src/components/platform/dashboard/tenants/columns.tsx`
  - Queries: `src/components/platform/dashboard/tenants/queries.ts`
  - Wrapper: `src/components/platform/dashboard/tenants/table.tsx`
  - Note: Server-driven pagination/sort; filters to be added with `nuqs`.

### Cleanup & Centralization
- Removed old site demo dashboard.
- Centralized dashboard chrome under `src/components/template/dashboard-header` and `src/components/template/dashboard-sidebar`.

### Next steps
- Implement subdomain → `schoolId` mapping in middleware.
- Restrict `/dashboard/tenants` to DEVELOPER when roles are finalized.
- Add audit logs with `{ requestId, schoolId, userId }`.
- Operator guard planned: `/operator/**` restricted to DEVELOPER via middleware and layout. Currently disabled for demo.
 - Impersonation UX: banner under the header shows target school and provides a stop button. Controlled by `impersonate_schoolId` cookie.
## Dashboards (Operator and Client)

Two dashboards share one central codebase and database:

- Operator Dashboard (platform team): run the SaaS - schools, billing, domains, moderation, observability.
- Client Dashboard (per school): run the school - roles, classes, subjects, students, teachers, timetable, attendance, announcements, billing.

Both follow the same patterns: shadcn/ui components, URL-to-state sync where useful, Prisma with tenant scoping, and server actions for mutations.

### Architecture

- Multi-tenant shared schema (Neon + Prisma). Every business table includes schoolId.
- Tenant resolution via subdomain (for example, hogwarts.hogwarts.app) and session.
- Central logic: shared actions, filters, table block, and role gates.
- RBAC: Owner, Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent, Accountant (add Staff or Support for Operator).

### Operator Dashboard (Platform)

Scope:

- Schools: list, create, suspend, plan, limits, trial countdown.
- Domains: subdomain issuance, custom domain requests, CNAME verification.
- Billing: invoices, manual receipts, refunds, revenue metrics.
- Observability: logs, error reports, backups status, job queue.
- Moderation and Support: impersonate (audited), reset domain, manage users.

Implementation:

 - Routes under app/operator/* or app/(operator)/* with guard middleware.
   - Implemented guard checks `req.auth.user.role === "DEVELOPER"` and otherwise redirects to `/403`.
- Lists use the generic table block (/docs/table), filtering by any platform fields.
- Server actions for domain approval, plan changes, suspensions.
- Role gates: RoleGate for platform roles (for example, DEVELOPER, STAFF).

Tenant safety:

- Platform views can search across all schools. Mutations must specify the target schoolId and log an audit entry.
- Impersonation creates an audit trail (who, when, why) and a time-limited session.

### Operator MVP Progress and Checklist

Current status vs MVP scope:

- Overview KPIs
  - Implemented: `src/app/(platform)/operator/overview/layout.tsx` shows totals for schools, active schools, users, students.
  - Next: Add trend metrics and drill‑downs (optional post‑MVP).

- Tenants
  - Implemented: List/table, server query, activate/suspend action with revalidation.
    - Files: `src/app/(platform)/operator/tenants/page.tsx`, `src/components/platform/operator/tenants/*`, `src/app/(platform)/operator/actions/tenants/toggle-active.ts`.
  - Remaining (MVP):
    - [x] Audit log for activate/suspend with `{ userId, schoolId, action, reason }`.
    - [x] Confirm dialog (reason prompt) and server revalidation.
    - [x] URL‑synced filters (status/plan/search) using `nuqs`.

- Impersonation (Moderation/Support)
  - Implemented: Start/stop with cookie + banner + audit log entries.
    - Files: `src/app/(platform)/operator/actions/impersonation/*`, `src/components/platform/operator/impersonation-banner.tsx`, `prisma/models/audit.prisma`.
  - Remaining (MVP):
    - [x] Time‑limited impersonation (30‑min cookie) and explicit reason capture.
    - [x] Disable sensitive actions while impersonating (except Stop) — enforced in server actions.

- Domains
  - Implemented: `DomainRequest` model (awaiting migration), operator page scaffold with actions wired (disabled until migration).
    - Files: `prisma/models/domain.prisma`, `src/app/(platform)/operator/domains/page.tsx`, actions in `src/app/(platform)/operator/actions/domains/*`.
  - Remaining (MVP):
    - [ ] Run Prisma migration and enable actions (Approve/Reject/Verify) in UI.
    - [x] Add audit logs on each action.
    - [ ] Add Zod validations for actions.
    - [ ] Optional: school‑side request form and status surface (client dashboard).

- Billing
  - Implemented: Placeholder route.
  - Remaining (MVP):
    - [ ] Add `Invoice` and `Receipt` models (schoolId, amount, status, file/url).
    - [ ] List invoices + manual receipt review/approval actions with audit.
    - [ ] Basic revenue metrics card(s) on overview.

- Observability
  - Implemented: AuditLog list/table (`/operator/observability`).
    - Files: `src/app/(platform)/operator/observability/page.tsx`, `src/components/platform/operator/observability/logs-table/*`.
  - Remaining (MVP):
    - [ ] Filters: action, user, school, date range; pagination.
    - [ ] Placeholders for errors/backups/jobs; wire when available.

- Subdomain → tenant mapping
  - Implemented: Middleware attaches `x-subdomain`; server resolves to `schoolId` in `getTenantContext()`.
    - Files: `src/middleware.ts`, `src/lib/tenant.ts`.
  - Remaining (MVP):
    - [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN` and verify mapping in all environments.
    - [ ] Fallback/dev param `?x-school=<subdomain>` documented and gated.

- Access control
  - Implemented: Guard code present (middleware + layout) and currently disabled for public demo.
  - Remaining (MVP):
    - [ ] Re‑enable DEVELOPER‑only guard for `/operator/**` in `src/middleware.ts` and `src/app/(platform)/operator/layout.tsx`.

Operational checklists (to reach production‑ready MVP):

- Database & migrations
  - [ ] Run `pnpm prisma generate`.
  - [ ] Run `pnpm prisma migrate dev --name add_audit_and_domain_request`.
  - [ ] Seed: 3 demo schools, a few `DomainRequest`, and `AuditLog` entries.

- Server actions & validation
  - [ ] Add Zod schemas for operator actions (toggle active, domains) with typed results.
  - [ ] Add `withOperatorAuth` helper to assert DEVELOPER role and capture `{ userId, requestId }`.
  - [ ] Rate‑limit sensitive actions (basic limiter).

- UX polish
  - [ ] Confirm modals for suspend/activate and domain actions.
  - [ ] Disable mutations during impersonation; banner shows target school and expiry.

- Observability & audit
  - [ ] Ensure all sensitive actions write `AuditLog`.
  - [ ] Add minimal filters/pagination to logs table.

- Guards & security
  - [ ] Re‑enable `/operator/**` guard; verify unauthorized → `/403`.

- Docs
  - [ ] Update once billing models land and actions are enabled.

Quick re‑enable steps (when demo phase ends):

- Uncomment operator guard block in `src/middleware.ts`.
- Uncomment auth/role checks in `src/app/(platform)/operator/layout.tsx`.

### Operator Actions
- Toggle tenant active state: `POST /operator/actions/tenants/[tenantId]/toggle-active` (DEVELOPER only). Revalidates `/operator/tenants`.
- Start impersonation: `POST /operator/actions/impersonation/[schoolId]/start` (DEVELOPER only). Sets cookie `impersonate_schoolId` and logs audit entry.
- Stop impersonation: `POST /operator/actions/impersonation/stop` (DEVELOPER only). Clears cookie and logs audit entry.

### Client Dashboard (Per School)

Scope:

- Setup: profile, branding, locale and timezone, domain request.
- People: users and roles, parents, students, teachers.
- Structure: classes, subjects, timetable slots.
- Operations: attendance, announcements.
- Billing: plan, trial, invoices, manual receipt upload.

Implementation:

- Subdomain-based routing: school.hogwarts.app resolves to schoolId.
- All server queries include schoolId (inject from middleware or context).
- Lists reuse the generic table; columns define filters via meta.variant and options.
- Server actions for all mutations, revalidate paths after changes.

RBAC examples:

- Owner or Admin: full access. Teacher: classes they teach. Parent: linked students. Student: own data.

### Data Flow (Both Dashboards)

1) Resolve tenant and role.
2) Parse URL for filters, sort, page.
3) Build Prisma where and orderBy, with schoolId enforced for client dashboard; optional for operator dashboard.
4) Fetch data and total, then compute pageCount.
5) Render with table block; server actions mutate and revalidate.

### Production Readiness

- Security: least privilege, audit trails for sensitive actions (domain, billing, impersonation).
- Tenant isolation: all client queries and unique constraints scoped by schoolId.
- Observability: request IDs, schoolId, and user ID in logs; error tracking with release tags.
- Backups and disaster recovery: daily backups, retention 7 and 30 days; restore drills.
- Internationalization and RTL: Arabic and English; mirrored icons and arrows.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation and roles across both UIs.
- Performance: indexes for frequent filters; pagination; avoid N+1; cache lists where safe.

### Reuse and Extensibility

- Reuse table, filters, operators, and toolbars for any list (students, teachers, invoices, domains).
- Define column factories per domain; keep server query helpers tenant-aware.
- Centralize role gates and nav items by role; show or hide features by plan.

### Environment & Config (Operator)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN`: used by middleware to derive subdomain → tenant mapping (e.g., `hogwarts.app`).
- Dev convenience param: `?x-school=<subdomain>` will be read by middleware and passed as `x-subdomain` header.
- Impersonation cookie: `impersonate_schoolId` controls banner and context override.

### Operator APIs (server actions / routes)
- Tenants: `POST /operator/actions/tenants/[tenantId]/toggle-active`.
- Impersonation: `POST /operator/actions/impersonation/[schoolId]/start`, `POST /operator/actions/impersonation/stop`.
- Domains (enable after migration):
  - Approve: `POST /operator/actions/domains/approve`
  - Reject: `POST /operator/actions/domains/reject`
  - Verify: `POST /operator/actions/domains/verify`

### Data Models (Operator)
- AuditLog (implemented):
```prisma
model AuditLog {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId     String
  schoolId   String?
  action     String
  reason     String?
  ip         String?
  userAgent  String?
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
}
```
- DomainRequest (scaffolded, pending migration):
```prisma
model DomainRequest {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  schoolId   String
  domain     String
  status     String   @default("pending") // pending|approved|rejected|verified
  notes      String?
  verifiedAt DateTime?
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt
  school     School   @relation(fields: [schoolId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  @@unique([schoolId, domain])
}
```
  - Planned: `Invoice`, `Receipt` (billing MVP).

### Enable Production Guards (when demo ends)
- Uncomment DEVELOPER guard block in `src/middleware.ts` (redirect unauthorized to `/403`).
- Uncomment auth/role checks in `src/app/(platform)/operator/layout.tsx`.

### Commands
```bash
pnpm prisma generate
pnpm prisma migrate dev --name add_audit_and_domain_request
```
