## Premium Model Strategy

Claude Code uses only the highest-tier models:

### Claude Opus 4.1
Used for the **orchestrate** agent:
- **Superior multi-agent coordination**
- **Complex reasoning** for breaking down features
- **Strategic planning** of parallel/sequential execution

### Claude Sonnet 4.5
Used for all other technical agents:
- **Maximum code quality** and understanding
- **Deep technical expertise**
- **Comprehensive context** handling
- **No quality compromises**

---

## Agent Orchestration

### Parallel Execution

When tasks are independent, agents run in parallel:

```bash
/agents/orchestrate -p "In parallel:
1. Generate tests for StudentForm
2. Check security in auth module
3. Optimize Dashboard performance
4. Update documentation"
```

### Sequential Execution

When tasks have dependencies, agents run sequentially:

```bash
/agents/orchestrate -p "Sequential:
1. Create database migration
2. Update Prisma schema
3. Generate types
4. Create API endpoints"
```

---

## Platform-Specific Expertise

All agents are configured with Hogwarts platform knowledge:

- **Multi-tenant architecture** - schoolId scoping
- **Mirror pattern** - route/component structure
- **Server-first** - Server components and actions
- **Bilingual** - Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR)
- **Typography system** - Semantic HTML only
- **95% test coverage** - TDD approach

---

## Migration from Old Agent Names

If you were using the previous version:

```bash
# Old → New mappings
/agents/architect → /agents/architecture
/agents/bug → /agents/debug
/agents/review → /agents/react-reviewer
/agents/git → /agents/git-github
/agents/github → /agents/git-github
/agents/pattern → /agents/architecture

# Removed (automated)
/agents/prettier → Auto-format via hooks
/agents/build → Merged into /agents/nextjs
```
