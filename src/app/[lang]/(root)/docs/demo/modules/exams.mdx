### 5. Automated Marking (Instant) (5 minutes)

**How It Works**:
System automatically grades objective questions the moment student submits exam.

**Objective Question Types** (Auto-Graded):
1. **Multiple Choice (MCQ)**:
   - Compare student answer to correct option
   - Match → Full points
   - No match → Zero points
2. **True/False**:
   - Simple boolean comparison
   - Instant result
3. **Fill in the Blank**:
   - Exact match OR synonym match
   - Example: "Eleven" = "11" = "11 countries"
   - Uses fuzzy matching for flexibility
4. **Matching**:
   - Check each pair
   - Partial credit: 1 point per correct match

**Grading Algorithm**:
```
For each objective question:
  student_answer = extract_answer(submission)
  correct_answer = get_correct_answer(question)

  if question.type == MCQ:
    points = student_answer == correct_answer ? question.points : 0

  elif question.type == TRUE_FALSE:
    points = student_answer == correct_answer ? question.points : 0

  elif question.type == FILL_BLANK:
    # Fuzzy matching with 90% similarity threshold
    similarity = calculate_similarity(student_answer, correct_answer)
    points = similarity >= 0.9 ? question.points : 0

  elif question.type == MATCHING:
    correct_pairs = count_correct_pairs(student_answer, correct_answer)
    points = correct_pairs * points_per_pair

  total_score += points

return total_score
```

**Instant Feedback**:
- Student sees score immediately
- Color-coded results:
  - Green ✅: Correct (+2 points)
  - Red ❌: Wrong (0 points, shows correct answer)
- Running total updated in real-time

**Demo Data**:
