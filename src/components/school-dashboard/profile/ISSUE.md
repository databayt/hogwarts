- [x] Multi-tenant scoping in all reads/actions
- [x] Zod validation on all inputs (incl. mobile PUT)
- [x] Dictionary-driven UI (en + ar parity); fixed `dictionary.school.profile` path bug
- [x] `error.tsx` + `loading.tsx` route boundaries
- [ ] Two-factor authentication setup (enhancement)
- [ ] Session management (view/revoke active sessions) (enhancement)
- [ ] Privacy settings (control profile visibility) (enhancement)

## 2026-08-15 — student → application link

- [x] `getProfileView` selects the student's `application` (id, number,
      channel, status) on both the User-backed and orphan-entity paths;
      `ProfileViewData.application` (typed `ProfileApplicationView | null`).
      Populated only for `ADMIN` / `STAFF` viewers (`ADMISSION_VIEWERS`) — the
      admission detail page is RBAC-gated, so the link is not offered to
      OWNER/RELATED/PUBLIC who cannot open it.
- [x] Sidebar renders an "Application <number>" row linking to
      `/{lang}/admission/applications/{id}` (clean path). Null-safe: most
      demo students have no application until the legacy backfill runs.
- [x] `school.profile.sidebar.application` key (en + ar).

## Done This Pass (2026-07-19 — data-alive + role polish)

- **New seed `profile-activity`** (wired into `seedMain` + `db:seed:single`):
  current-year section attendance marked by the demo teacher (student + teacher
  graphs light up), UserActivity feed rows for demo accounts + roster/teachers/
  guardians, role-appropriate pinned items from real rows, parent↔teacher
  conversation with parent-sent messages (parent graph), expense approvals
  spread across admin/staff/accountant (staff graph), demo-student achievements
  in distinct categories, status/website/social/timezone User fields, badge
  recompute. Fully idempotent (existing-row guards + deterministic PRNG).
- **Badge artwork fixed**: source PNGs found in `/public/github` were never on
  the CDN → uploaded 26 files to the CDN origin bucket as `hogwarts/<icon>.png`
  (`prisma/scripts/upload-badge-art.ts`); `profile-images` avatar seed fixed
  (bucket-owner-enforced: no ACL; upload to `databayt-cdn`, not the app bucket).
- **BADGE_CATALOG titles/descriptions now Arabic** (single-language storage —
  ar is the schools' content language; EN localizes via the getLabels batch).
- **Sidebar renders the fields the form edits**: website, social links (LTR,
  external), joined/enrolled date, pronouns beside the role label.
- **Achievements tab is real** — earned-badge grid (art, level chip, earn date)
  instead of duplicating the role dashboard; staff gained an Organizations tab.
- **Parent children cards link to the child's profile** (orphan-entity path).
- **Localization coverage**: activity titles/descriptions, lastName, section/
  department names, pinned descriptions + metadata stat labels, and roleDetail
  lists (subjects/classes/children) joined the getLabels batch; subjects stat
  now counts DISTINCT subjects (matches the tab count).
- **UTC date rendering** across feed/graph/sidebar/achievements — fixes an SSR
  hydration mismatch for near-midnight timestamps (server TZ ≠ browser TZ) and
  off-by-one-day graph tooltips in negative-offset timezones; graph grid is now
  week-aligned (was chunked from Jan 1 regardless of weekday) with a GitHub-style
  "{count} {label} in {year}" total.
- Browser-verified on demo (AR + EN): student, teacher, parent, admin; 79/79
  profile tests + dictionary parity green.

## Done Earlier (2026-06-15 — full build-out)

- **De-fabrication**: removed hardcoded sidebar stats/achievements/organizations,
  `Math.random()` activity, mock pinned items, fake tab counts and the fake
  "achievements unlocked" / "1,086 contributions" banner.
- **New data layer**: `queries.ts` (`getProfileView`) returns a typed, real,
  permission-masked view model; `badges.ts` earning engine; new Prisma models.
- **Security (audit-confirmed)**:
  - P1 `getPermissionLevel` cross-school elevation — ADMIN/STAFF/TEACHER/ACCOUNTANT now require same school (DEVELOPER is the only cross-tenant role).
  - P1 `getContributionData` role lookup now `findFirst({ id, schoolId })` (no cross-tenant enumeration).
  - P1 dead `getUserProfileRole` IDOR — **deleted**.
  - P2 `getRecentActivity` now has a viewer-permission gate.
  - P2 mobile `PUT /api/mobile/profile` now Zod-validated.
  - P2 `fetchParentActivities` unscoped payment stub — **removed**.
- **Dead code removed**: `getStudentProfile/getTeacherProfile/getParentProfile/getStaffProfile`,
  `getUserProfileWithGitHubFields`, `updateProfile/updateProfileBio/updateProfileSettings`,
  `getUserProfileRole`, `canSelfEdit/getSelfEditableSteps`, ~700 lines of dead types.
- **a11y**: graph cells are focusable buttons with labels; icon-only buttons labelled;
  form inputs label-associated; loading skeleton matches real layout.

## Known Issues / Follow-ups

### P1

- ~~DB tables deploy-pending~~ — applied to prod 2026-06-15. On the next deploy run
  `pnpm db:seed:single profile-extras && pnpm db:seed:single profile-activity`
  against the prod demo so its profile surfaces populate (ensure-demo
  short-circuits an already-seeded school).

### P2

- Contribution graph is keyed by `User.id` — wizard-created students with no User
  row (the orphan path parents click through to) show an honest empty graph even
  when the student has attendance. Keying student graphs by the Student entity
  would light them.

- Adding a NEW pinned item from the UI is not yet wired (display + reorder + remove
  are). Needs an item picker sourced from subjects/classes/children.
- `profile-flows.spec.ts` predates the rebuild — update selectors + add a
  cross-school isolation case + the chrome-error skip pattern.
- `filterProfileData` / `canViewField` in `permissions.ts` document the field-mask
  policy but `queries.ts` masks inline — consider consolidating onto them.

## Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- 2FA (TOTP/SMS), session management, privacy/visibility settings
- Avatar crop/resize before upload; email-change verification flow
- Profile completeness indicator
