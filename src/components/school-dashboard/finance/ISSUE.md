**Overall ≈ 88%** (average of the readiness column after the 2026-06-13 admission+finance production-readiness pass).

## MVP Checklist

- [x] Currency driven by `School.currency` everywhere -- no `$` or `SDG` hardcodes
- [x] All `date-fns format()` calls pass locale from `date-fns/locale`
- [x] Server actions use `actionError(ACTION_ERRORS.*)` + client `ERROR_MAP`
- [x] Notification dispatch uses `finance.notifications.*` keys (no bilingual ternaries)
- [x] Locale-aware formatters in `lib/format.ts`
- [x] Public docs: hub + per-sub-block pages (`/docs/finance`, EN) — 2026-05-21
- [~] Wire the orphaned posting functions — `postFeeAssignment` (assignFee + bulkAssignFees) and `postWalletTopup` now wired; `postInvoicePayment` / `postExpensePayment` blocked on missing payment-recording flows, `postSalaryPayment` on the unbalanced rule (see P0)
- [ ] `postFeePayment` made transactional with rollback — deliberately deferred (fire-and-forget by design; shared with the reconciliation story)
- [x] `debit = credit` invariant test on actual posting — `lib/accounting/posting-rules.test.ts` (15/15 green after the `toCents` fix below)
- [ ] `lang` field on user-facing finance models + `getText` routing
- [ ] 11 `validation.ts` factories wired to `ValidationHelper` in consumers
- [ ] Test coverage for the 11 untested sub-modules
- [ ] PDF rendering wired for invoice (fees receipt PDF already works)
- [ ] Plaid live-credential sandbox run + Dwolla webhook handler
- [ ] AR mirror of the new public docs (`content/docs-ar/finance*.mdx`)

## Verified Gap Register

All items below were verified against live code on 2026-05-21 (file:line cited). See per-sub-module `ISSUE.md` for finer detail.

### P0 -- correctness / data integrity

The block-level "P0: none" of prior cycles was inaccurate. These are silent-data-integrity issues:

- **3 of 6 domain posting functions are now wired; the other 3 are blocked on more than wiring.** Wired: `postFeePayment` (fees + Stripe/Tap webhooks), `postWalletTopup` (wallet top-up), and — 2026-06-20 — `postFeeAssignment` (`assignFee` + `bulkAssignFees`). Wiring assignment was a **correctness fix, not just coverage**: the accrual model recognizes revenue at assignment (DR Receivable / CR Revenue) and the payment post only clears the receivable (DR Cash / CR Receivable), so with payment wired but assignment not, the receivable was credited without ever being debited (driven negative) and revenue was never recognized. Still unwired, each blocked beyond wiring: **`postInvoicePayment`** — `UserInvoice` has no record-payment action (only the generic edit form + a `sentAt` stamp), so there is no payment event to hook; **`postExpensePayment`** — `approveExpense` only accepts `APPROVED`/`REJECTED` (never `PAID`), so no expense ever reaches a payment state; **`postSalaryPayment`** — the rule itself is unbalanced (below).
- **`createSalaryPaymentEntry` does not balance when tax > 0 (NEW P0).** It debits `gross + payroll-tax-expense` but credits only `net + tax-payable + ss-payable` (= gross), so debits exceed credits by the tax amount and `validateDoubleEntry` rejects it; it also has no line for generic "other deductions". This is why `postSalaryPayment` cannot simply be wired — the withholding model needs correcting and all payroll deductions mapped to contra/payable lines. (`posting-rules.test.ts` asserts only the no-withholding case for this reason.)
- **`toCents` ×100 ledger inflation — FIXED in code 2026-06-20 (`916327882`); DATA MIGRATION still pending.** The posting rules used to store `toCents(amount)` while `LedgerEntry.debit/credit` is `Decimal(12,2)` whole units. Read-side investigation confirmed whole-units is correct (Payment.amount is whole units; `banking/reconciliation` reads `LedgerEntry.debit` raw and compares to Payment sums; `fromCents` has zero callers; no reader divides by 100). `toCents` is dropped from all six rules and `posting-rules.test.ts` is green. **Remaining:** existing rows written by the live `postFeePayment` (Stripe/Tap) are still ×100, so the fix must NOT be deployed alone — ship it with a one-time migration that divides the inflated rows by 100. Scope the migration to **posting-rule-created** `LedgerEntry`/`AccountBalance` rows (e.g. `sourceModule IN (FEES,PAYROLL,EXPENSES,INVOICE,WALLET)`); manual journal entries were entered in whole units and must be excluded. Approval-gated + Neon-branch-first.
- **`finance/content.tsx` renders revenue/expenses/pending at 1/100 (NEW, separate from the ledger).** It sums `Payment.amount` (whole units) but formats with the `÷100 formatCurrency` from `lib/format` → shows 1/100 of the real figure. Fix: use `formatMoney` (whole units). Audit other call-sites of the `÷100 formatCurrency` for the same misuse.
- **`postFeePayment` is fire-and-forget with no rollback (by design).** On post failure it logs but does **not** roll back the recorded payment; the newly-wired `postFeeAssignment`/`postWalletTopup` follow the same deliberate pattern. The rollback/reconciliation story is tracked separately from wiring the posters.

### P1 -- functional / misleading

- **Dashboard trend charts are `Math.random()` mock data** (`dashboard/actions.ts:278-288` — `generateTrend()` for revenues/expenses/profit/collection). KPI totals are real DB aggregations; only the sparkline trends are fabricated.
- **Payroll tax is a hardcoded flat 15%** (`payroll/actions.ts:286` — `grossSalary * 0.15 // Simplified 15% tax rate`). No brackets, no per-country rules. (Prior doc claimed 0% — corrected.)
- **Invoice PDF not wired.** Infrastructure exists at `src/components/file/generate/invoice.tsx` but nothing in `finance/invoice/**` imports it. Contrast: the **fees receipt PDF is real** (`fees/receipt-pdf.tsx`, `@react-pdf/renderer`).
- **No finance Prisma model has a `lang` field.** DB-stored, user-facing finance text (`Fine.reason`, `Scholarship` name/description, `ExpenseCategory`, `ChartOfAccount` account names, `FeeStructure` name/description) renders English-only on the Arabic side. The rest of the platform uses the `lang` + `getText` convention; finance can't.
- **Test coverage: 11 of 14 sub-modules have zero tests** (see table below).
- **11 `validation.ts` factories are uncalled by their consumers** — Zod schemas exist but mutations don't run them; messages are still hardcoded English (`// TODO: add custom validation key`).

### P2 -- stubs / incomplete

- **`invoice/bulk-generate.tsx`** — fully stubbed ("Bulk invoice generation is currently unavailable"); blocked on the deleted `actions-enhanced.ts`. Needs reimplementation from the current schema.
- ~~`banking/reconciliation-panel.tsx`~~ — **REPLACED 2026-05-28** by Aldar P2.3. New live 3-column diff at `/finance/banking/reconciliation` and `/finance/accounts/reconciliation`. Persistence into `BankReconciliation` model deferred to v2; today's view computes live.
- **`banking/my-banks` Plaid sync** — stub (`"Bank sync is not yet implemented"`); needs live Plaid sandbox creds. Dwolla webhook handler missing.
- **`bankak` provider** (`src/lib/payment/providers/bankak.ts`) — intentional placeholder; `createCheckout` always returns `success:false` pending Bank of Khartoum API spec.
- **Refunds absent from the `PaymentProvider` interface.** It declares only `supportsCurrency` / `isConfigured` / `createCheckout` — no `verifyWebhook`, no `createRefund`. The only refund logic is Stripe **course-enrollment** refunds in `api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`; there is no fee/invoice/wallet refund path (wallet refunds are manual journal entries).

### P3 -- backlog

- Recurring invoices · installment-plan UI for fees (schema exists) · expenses CSV bulk import · salary increment automation + salary history · payslip PDF + bank-file export · scheduled report exports + multi-currency conversion fix · wallet refund + low-balance alerts · audit log for permission changes · fee defaulters list.

### Stale entries removed this pass

Deleted references to files that no longer exist: `content-enhanced.tsx`, `invoice/onboarding/actions.ts`, `invoice/settings/actions.ts`. The `actions-enhanced.ts` items are reframed above as "blocked on deleted file — needs reimplementation" (P2) rather than open wiring tasks.

## Improvements & Optimizations

Forward-looking work beyond closing the gaps above.

- **Accounting integrity** — wire the 5 orphaned posting functions (or remove the false posting claims from sub-READMEs); make `postFeePayment` transactional with rollback; add a `debit = credit` invariant test plus a per-school trial-balance test.
- **Remove mock data** — replace the dashboard `Math.random()` trends with real historical aggregation off the ledger / payment tables.
- **Payments interface** — add `verifyWebhook` + `createRefund` to `PaymentProvider`; generalize the Stripe-only refund to fees/invoice/wallet; finish `bankak` once the BoK spec lands.
- **i18n migration** — add `lang` to `FeeStructure`, `Scholarship`, `ExpenseCategory`, `ChartOfAccount`, `Fine`; route display through `getText` / `getFields`; wire the 11 `validation.ts` factories to `ValidationHelper`.
- **Code-reuse / perf** — consolidate the duplicated DataTable + columns + list-params patterns across sub-modules; audit N+1 in dashboard and report aggregations; verify the Decimal whole-units-vs-cents convention per model against `lib/format.ts` (`formatMoney` vs `formatCurrency`) to prevent off-by-100 bugs.
- **PDF** — wire the invoice PDF (map `UserInvoice` fields to the `file/generate/invoice.tsx` template + add a download button); add payslip PDF for payroll.
- **Testing** — cover the 11 untested sub-modules, money-movers first (payroll, expenses, wallet, then the others).

## Recent Work (2026-06-13 — Admission+Finance production-readiness pass)

### Schema

- `InvoiceStatus` extended with `PARTIAL` — tracks invoices partially paid via multi-installment allocation.
- `UserInvoice` gains `amountPaid` (Decimal) + `sentAt` (DateTime) — enables partial-payment tracking + email audit trail.
- Indexes added: `invoices(schoolId)`, `AdmissionInquiry(convertedToApplicationId)`, `ApplicationSession(convertedToApplicationId)`.
- Prisma model files renamed: `finance-fees.prisma` → `fees.prisma`, `finance-invoices.prisma` → `invoices.prisma`, etc. (bare names, no `finance-` prefix). Migration of record: `prisma/migrations/20260612200000_invoice_partial_payment_and_indexes`.

### 4-Level Fee Inheritance (owner's core spec)

The fee system now enforces a strict four-level cascade:

1. **Level 1 — Onboarding auto-provision**: when a school completes the pricing step, fee structures are automatically provisioned per-grade (one FeeStructure per grade per fee type). Zero manual setup required.
2. **Level 2 — Per-grade fine-tune**: ADMIN/ACCOUNTANT edits a grade's FeeStructure (amount, due date, installment plan). Applies to new assignments only.
3. **Level 3 — `propagateFeeStructureChange` cascade**: when a grade-level structure is edited, the action cascades the change to all existing uncollected `FeeAssignment` rows for students in that grade — preserving any per-student discount that was already set. Collected assignments are never touched.
4. **Level 4 — `updateFeeAssignmentDiscount` per-student fine-tune**: ADMIN/ACCOUNTANT adjusts a specific student's discount (amount or %) without touching the grade structure or other students.

### Invoice

- Access scoping fixed: ADMIN and ACCOUNTANT now see all invoices for their school (school-wide), not just their own user's invoices. STUDENT/GUARDIAN see only their own.
- OVERDUE status mirrored from fee-overdue cron to `UserInvoice` — invoice list reflects late payments without manual refresh.
- `amountPaid` + `PARTIAL` status surfaced in the invoice detail view and list columns.
- `sendInvoiceEmail` action: sender address fixed (no longer hardcoded `onboarding@resend.dev`), action-button URL is now absolute.
- Linked payments displayed in the invoice detail panel.

### Fees

- `createFeePaymentCheckout` is gateway-aware: AED-currency schools are routed to Tap; others remain Stripe-default.
- Currency snapshot recorded on `FeeAssignment` at creation time.
- Fee-overdue cron (`/api/cron/fee-overdue`) is now per-tenant (iterates all schools, not just one).

### Receipts

- Receipt PDF route (`/api/payment/[paymentId]/receipt`) is status-guarded (PAID/CLEARED only), i18n-ready, includes school name + currency.
- My-fees receipt link wired — students/guardians can download receipts directly from `/finance/fees/my`.
- Expense-receipt upload `FormData` mismatch fixed.

### Reminders / Crons

- New `/api/cron/fee-due` (daily): fires upcoming-due + offer-expiry reminder notifications per tenant.
- Fee-overdue cron: mirrors OVERDUE to `UserInvoice` rows; per-channel preference enforced for bulk dispatch.
- Direct-email path added for guest applicants (no account yet).
- New `/api/cron/process-document-jobs` (`*/10`): runs the AI document-extraction queue.

### Deferred (open)

- True server-side search on merit/enrollment tables (currently per-page client filter).
- Issue #269: fee-structure-creation-as-modal UX.
- Onboarding re-provision on tuition-change (Level 1 only fires once today).
- `application-status-banner-client.tsx` + `INQUIRY_SOURCES`/`DEFAULT_GRADES` i18n migration.
- `payment/content.tsx` dead-file cleanup.
- True PARTIAL → PAID transition from `recordPayment` edge cases.

## Recent Work (2026-05-28 — Aldar UAE P0+P1+P2+P3, see [#356](https://github.com/databayt/hogwarts/issues/356))

- **P0 demo-able** — `formatCurrency` big-bang (currency required across ~30 files), Stripe wallet auto-unlock, parent-side gateway picker on fee assignment page, Aldar demo seed (`pnpm db:seed:aldar`).
- **P1 production gates** — currency snapshot columns on Payment + Fee tables (live + backfilled), Tap webhook fails-closed on missing secret, `Payment.gatewayMethod` preserves Tap source provenance, `PaymentMethod` enum extended (APPLE_PAY/GOOGLE_PAY/MADA/KNET/ATM_DEPOSIT), server-side payment receipt PDF at `/api/payment/[paymentId]/receipt`.
- **P2 feature parity** — `PaymentStatus.PENDING_VERIFICATION` + offline-payment capture fields (depositSlipUrl/bankBranch/IBAN), `markPaymentCleared` server action with `$transaction`-wrapped status flip + ledger post + invoice sync + notifications, ATM-deposit form variant, reconciliation report (Payments / Gateway / Ledger 3-column diff), branded receipt PDF (school logo + signature).
- **P3 polish** — 5 Stripe webhook events added (subscription updated/deleted, invoice.payment_failed, payment_intent.succeeded/failed — the succeeded handler retroactively enriches `Payment.gatewayMethod` with the wallet identity), Tap webhook FAILED/DECLINED dispatches retry notification, sidebar reconciliation links thread `/${locale}` prefix, payment-method names localized en + ar.
- Migration records at `prisma/migrations/20260528000000_aldar_payment_p1/` and `20260528010000_aldar_payment_p2/`.

## Recent Work (2026-05-21)

- Documentation overhaul: public `/docs/finance` hub + 14 sub-block pages (EN); README matrix reconciled; this ISSUE.md rebuilt as the verified gap register with an Improvements & Optimizations section.
- Verified (file:line) the orphaned-posting P0, dashboard mock trends, payroll flat-15% tax, fee-payment fire-and-forget posting.

## Recent Work (2026-04-20, prior cycle)

- Locale-aware currency + date formatting across 16 sites; 24 orphan AR dictionary keys added; error-code pattern + client ERROR_MAP in banking/invoice/receipt/fees/payroll; dictionary-driven notifications; `finance/CLAUDE.md` created.

## Dependencies

- Next.js 16, React 19, Prisma 6, TypeScript 5
- Stripe (@stripe/stripe-js, stripe server SDK)
- Plaid (plaid + react-plaid-link)
- @react-pdf/renderer (fees receipt PDF wired; invoice PDF not yet)
- date-fns (with ar/enUS locales)
- resend (invoice email)
- nuqs (URL state for DataTables)

## Acceptance Criteria

Every sub-module must:

1. Use `getTenantContext()` for `schoolId` (never raw session)
2. Check RBAC via `checkCurrentUserPermission()` for mutations
3. Return `ActionResponse<T>` via `actionError(ACTION_ERRORS.*)` -- no hardcoded English
4. Wrap multi-record writes in `db.$transaction`
5. Support Arabic + English through `getDictionary(lang)`
6. Accept `currency` (from `School.currency`) and `lang` props for all money/date rendering
