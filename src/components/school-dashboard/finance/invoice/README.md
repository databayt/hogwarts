## Invoice -- Billing & Invoice Management

### Overview

Full invoice lifecycle from draft to payment: wizard-based creation, auto-generation from enrollment/transport/purchases, itemized line items, a print-first document view (Milan minimalist-monospace design), public share links, PDF download, email delivery via Resend, and ledger posting on payment. Server actions gate through `finance/guard.ts` (`requireFinanceActor`); reads are deliberately owner-scoped so students/guardians reach their own invoices (see `requireAuthAndTenant` doc-comment in `actions.ts`).

### Capabilities by Role

- **Admin / Accountant / Developer**: full access — create, edit via wizard, delete, mark paid, share, send email, settings
- **Student/Guardian**: view own invoices only (list scoping + dashboard "Fee Payments" section + own-invoice detail/PDF); no mutations
- **Anyone with a share link**: view + print the public invoice page (token is the credential)

Tests: `src/tests/school-dashboard/finance/invoice/` (actions, wizard-actions, share, purchase-invoice, mark-invoice-paid, invoice-pdf-data, util, validation) + `src/tests/lib/fee-invoice-sync.test.ts` (itemization) + `src/tests/school-dashboard/finance/lib/invoice-allocation.test.ts`.

### Server Action Exports (actions.ts)

| Function                 | Gate                                   | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `getInvoicesWithFilters` | auth+tenant, owner-scoped              | Filtered list (privileged roles see all; others own) |
| `getInvoiceById`         | auth+tenant, owner-scoped              | Detail + linked payments + branding + share fields   |
| `deleteInvoice`          | `requireFinanceActor(invoice, delete)` | Delete + orphan-address cleanup                      |
| `sendInvoiceEmail`       | `requireFinanceActor(invoice, export)` | Resend email (public link when shared)               |
| `markInvoicePaid`        | `requireFinanceActor(invoice, edit)`   | Race-safe flip + `postInvoicePayment` ledger entry   |
| `updateUser`             | auth (own row)                         | Profile firstName/lastName/currency                  |
| `updateSettings`         | auth+tenant (own row)                  | Branding logo + signature                            |
| `getSettings`            | auth+tenant (own row)                  | Branding read (feeds PDF)                            |
| `getDashboardStats`      | auth+tenant, owner-scoped              | 30-day stats + school currency                       |

Share trio lives in `share.ts` (`shareInvoice`/`revokeInvoiceShare` gated `invoice:edit`; `getSharedInvoice` public by design — token lookup only, minimal select).

### Invoice Generation Paths (all auto-paths idempotent)

| Source                        | Entry                                                   | Result                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Manual                        | wizard (`createDraftInvoice` → details → items)         | Draft in school currency, prefilled sequential number              |
| Enrollment / student creation | `lib/fee-auto-assign.ts` → `lib/fee-invoice-sync.ts`    | `ENR-` invoices per assignment; **itemized** per fee component     |
| Transport route fees          | `finance/fees/transport-provisioning.ts` (admin button) | Per route+month FeeStructure → assignments → invoices              |
| Course/catalog/video purchase | Stripe webhook → `purchase-invoice.ts`                  | `PUR-<sessionId>` PAID invoice (skipped when checkout school-less) |

Registration fees collected at offer acceptance are allocated onto their invoice inside `confirmEnrollment`'s transaction via `allocatePaymentToInvoices(…, tx)` — the `tx` parameter is load-bearing (uncommitted rows).

### Itemization (fee-invoice-sync)

Single-installment invoices break into one line per non-zero `FeeStructure` component (tuition, admission, registration, exam, library, laboratory, sports, transport, hostel + `otherFees`), labeled via `finance.feeComponents` dictionary in the school's language. `sub_total` = component sum; scholarship gap goes to the invoice `discount` field; above-list billing adds an Adjustment line; zero components fall back to the lump-sum line. Multi-installment invoices keep "Installment N of M" lines.

### Output Infrastructure

| Capability      | Infrastructure                                              | Wired? |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Print (browser) | `window.print()` + global `@media print` chrome-strip       | Yes    |
| A4 PDF download | `@react-pdf` InvoiceTemplate (Milan design, IBM Plex Mono)  | Yes    |
| Public share    | `shareToken` route `/[lang]/invoice/[token]` + share dialog | Yes    |
| Email send      | Resend bilingual template                                   | Yes    |
| CSV export      | `util.ts::exportInvoiceToCSV()`                             | No UI  |

Branding: per-user `UserInvoiceSettings.invoiceLogo` overrides the school logo in the PDF, email, sheet, and public page.

### Status

**Completion:** ~97% — remaining items tracked in `ISSUE.md` (purchase ledger posting rule, invoice lifecycle notifications, i18n fallback debt).
