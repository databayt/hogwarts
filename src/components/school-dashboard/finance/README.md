## Finance Block -- Comprehensive School Finance Management

### Overview

The Finance Block is a feature-based financial management system for multi-tenant school operations. It implements double-entry bookkeeping with 14 specialized sub-blocks covering invoicing, fees, payroll, budgeting, banking, and more. All modules enforce `schoolId` scoping for tenant isolation.

### Status

**Completion:** 75% | **Blockers:** Invoice sub-block has legacy code needing cleanup; no test coverage across all sub-blocks

### Design Principles

1. **Feature-Based Architecture**: Each sub-block is self-contained with `types.ts`, `validation.ts`, `config.ts`, `actions.ts`, `content.tsx`
2. **Double-Entry Bookkeeping**: All financial transactions create balanced journal entries via `lib/accounting/`
3. **Multi-Tenant**: Row-level isolation using `schoolId` in every query
4. **Hybrid Permissions**: Role-based defaults + granular `FinancePermission` model (12 modules x 7 actions)
5. **Mirror Pattern**: Routes at `src/app/.../finance/<module>/` import from `src/components/school-dashboard/finance/<module>/content.tsx`

### Integration Points

- **Prisma schema**: `prisma/models/finance.prisma`
- **Shared permissions**: `src/components/school-dashboard/finance/lib/permissions.ts`
- **Accounting engine**: `src/components/school-dashboard/finance/lib/accounting/`
- **Tenant context**: `src/lib/tenant-context.ts`
- **Auth**: `src/auth.ts`
