## Finance Block -- Comprehensive School Finance Management

### Overview

The Finance Block is a feature-based financial management system for multi-tenant school operations. It implements double-entry bookkeeping with **14 specialized sub-modules** covering invoicing, fees, payroll, budgeting, banking, and more. All modules enforce `schoolId` scoping for tenant isolation.

~45k LOC total. Currency per-school via `School.currency`. Locale-aware formatting via `finance/lib/format.ts`. Server-side notifications dispatch through school's `preferredLanguage` dictionary.

### Honest Status Matrix

This matrix is the authoritative readiness view; it is kept identical to the banner in `ISSUE.md` and the matrix at `/docs/finance`. The **Ledger** column is the key honesty signal -- only fee payments reach the general ledger today.

| Sub-module  | Readiness | Ledger wired                       | i18n | Tests  | Docs |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ---- |
| invoice     | 90%       | ❌ `postInvoicePayment` orphaned   | ⚠️   | 🟢 131 | ✅   |
| fees        | 85%       | 🟡 fee payments only (no rollback) | ✅   | 🟡 13  | ✅   |
| budget      | 85%       | ➖ n/a                             | ✅   | ❌     | ✅   |
| receipt     | 85%       | ➖ n/a                             | ✅   | ❌     | ✅   |
| banking     | 80%       | ➖ n/a                             | ⚠️   | 🟡 5   | ✅   |
| dashboard   | 80%       | ➖ n/a (trends are mock)           | ✅   | ❌     | ✅   |
| expenses    | 80%       | ❌ `postExpensePayment` orphaned   | ⚠️   | ❌     | ✅   |
| accounts    | 75%       | 🟢 engine home (fee payments only) | ⚠️   | 🟡 10  | ✅   |
| permissions | 75%       | ➖ n/a                             | ⚠️   | ❌     | ✅   |
| reports     | 75%       | 🔗 reads ledger (fee-only data)    | ⚠️   | ❌     | ✅   |
| salary      | 75%       | ➖ n/a                             | ✅   | ❌     | ✅   |
| timesheet   | 75%       | ➖ n/a                             | ⚠️   | ❌     | ✅   |
| wallet      | 75%       | ❌ `postWalletTopup` orphaned      | ⚠️   | ❌     | ✅   |
| payroll     | 65%       | ❌ `postSalaryPayment` orphaned    | ✅   | ❌     | ✅   |

Legend -- **Ledger**: 🟢 posts · 🟡 posts but not transactional · ❌ posting fn exists but zero callers · 🔗 consumes ledger · ➖ not a money-mover. **i18n**: ✅ ready · ⚠️ validation strings still hardcoded English. **Tests**: 🟢 strong · 🟡 partial · ❌ none.

> **i18n caveat:** the i18n column tracks UI/validation strings only. Separately, **no finance Prisma model has a `lang` field**, so DB-stored finance text (`Fine.reason`, `Scholarship` / `ExpenseCategory` / `ChartOfAccount` names, `FeeStructure` name/description) can't use the platform's `getDisplayText` convention. Tracked in `ISSUE.md` P1.

Each sub-module has its own `ISSUE.md` with MVP checklist, known issues (P1/P2/P3), and test gaps. Root `ISSUE.md` is the verified gap register across the block.

### Status

**Overall completion:** ~79% (average of the matrix readiness column) · **Top blockers:** 5 of 6 ledger posting functions orphaned (P0), test coverage (11 of 14 sub-modules have none), validation-helper migration pending for 11 sub-modules. See `ISSUE.md` for the verified gap register.

### Design Principles

1. **Feature-based architecture**: Each sub-module is self-contained with `types.ts`, `validation.ts`, `config.ts`, `actions.ts`, `content.tsx`, `ISSUE.md`
2. **Double-entry bookkeeping**: A balanced-journal-entry engine lives at `lib/accounting/` (`posting-rules.ts` maps domain events to debit/credit lines). Today only **fee payments** are wired to it (`postFeePayment`); the posting functions for salary, expense, invoice, fee-assignment, and wallet exist but have no callers yet (see `ISSUE.md` P0). Do not assume a money event hits the ledger without checking
3. **Multi-tenant**: Row-level isolation using `schoolId` in every query
4. **Hybrid permissions**: Role-based defaults + granular `FinancePermission` model (12 modules x 7 actions)
5. **Mirror pattern**: Routes at `src/app/[lang]/s/[subdomain]/(school-dashboard)/finance/<module>/` import from `src/components/school-dashboard/finance/<module>/content.tsx`
6. **Locale-aware formatting**: `formatCurrency` / `formatMoney` / `formatDate` from `finance/lib/format.ts` -- never hardcode `$`, `SDG`, or English month names
7. **Dictionary-driven notifications**: Server actions load `finance.notifications.*` via `getDictionary(school.preferredLanguage)` -- no bilingual ternaries

### Integration Points

- **Prisma schema**: `prisma/models/finance-*.prisma` (finance-core, finance-fees, finance-payroll, finance-banking, finance-budgets, finance-invoices, finance-reports)
- **Shared permissions**: `finance/lib/permissions.ts`
- **Accounting engine**: `finance/lib/accounting/`
- **Tenant context**: `src/lib/tenant-context.ts`
- **Auth**: `src/auth.ts`
- **Notifications**: `src/components/school-dashboard/notifications/`
- **Translation**: `src/components/translation/` + `@/components/internationalization/helpers`

### Where to Start

- New contributor → read this README, then the `ISSUE.md` of the sub-module you'll touch
- Public docs → the user-facing mirror is `/docs/finance` (hub) + a page per sub-block (`/docs/finance-payroll`, `/docs/finance-accounts`, …, plus `/docs/fees`, `/docs/invoice`). Keep the `/docs/finance` status matrix in sync with the one above
- Adding a feature → confirm it's catalogued in the relevant `ISSUE.md` before coding
- Fixing a bug → update the sub-module `ISSUE.md` once shipped
- Money math change → read `lib/accounting/` first; double-entry invariants must hold
