### Overview

The Transportation block provides school bus and route management:

- **Fleet** — Vehicles (BUS/VAN/CAR/MINIBUS) with capacity, registration/insurance/inspection tracking
- **Drivers** — License records (class + expiry), contractor flag, optional bridges to `StaffMember` and `User`
- **Routes** — Named routes with origin → destination, departure/return times, ordered stops with drag-drop reorder, optional default vehicle and driver, optional monthly fee, optional geofence link
- **Assignments** — Student → Route → Stop with effective-from/to dates and direction (PICKUP/DROPOFF/ROUND_TRIP)
- **Trips** — Daily run instances scheduled per route+date+direction. State-machine guarded (SCHEDULED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED/CANCELLED). `start` auto-populates one PENDING boarding row per active assignment. Trip events (start/finish/cancel) fire guardian notifications.
- **Boarding** — Per-student BOARDED/ALIGHTED/MISSED/EXCUSED tracking; also driven by a geofence webhook
- **Settings** — Writable per-school config: pickup buffer, default monthly fee, per-event guardian-notification opt-outs, late threshold
- **Fee preview** — Read-only monthly transport-fee projection (finance owns actual `FeeRecord` creation)
- **Reports** — Trip stats (last 30 days), route utilization, driver hours
- **Self-service** — `/me` view for STUDENT/GUARDIAN; `/fees` view for ACCOUNTANT
- **Webhook** — `POST /api/transportation/geofence-boarding` for service-account geofence collectors

### Capabilities by Role (from `authorization.ts` `PERMISSION_MATRIX`)

| Role           | Vehicles/Routes/Drivers/Stops/Settings | Assignments | Trips  | Record boarding | Fee preview | Own view |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | --------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| **DEVELOPER**  | manage (all schools)                   | manage      | manage | yes             | yes         | n/a      |
| **ADMIN**      | manage                                 | manage      | manage | yes             | yes         | n/a      |

| **GUARDIAN**   | —                                      | —           | —      | —               | —           | children |

> The live sidebar (`template/platform-sidebar/config.ts`) wires per-role entries — `ADMIN/STAFF/DEVELOPER`
> → overview, `ACCOUNTANT` → `/fees`, `STUDENT/GUARDIAN` → `/me`, `TEACHER` → `/trips` — all with the
> `bus` icon and titles in the `platform.sidebar` dictionary (en + ar; P2-10 landed). (The older
> `school-dashboard/config.ts` is dead/legacy and not rendered.) The `PERMISSION_MATRIX` has **no dead
> entries** — the unused `read_class`/`export` permissions were removed (P2-5/P2-6).

### Routes

Page-level role gates live in each `page.tsx` (`ALLOWED_ROLES` → redirect to `/dashboard` if denied).
Server actions independently enforce the RBAC matrix via `requireContext()`.

| Route                                        | Page                                                | Allowed roles                    |

### Database Models

`prisma/models/transportation.prisma` — **9 models, 8 enums**. Every model is `schoolId`-scoped
with `@@index([schoolId, ...])` and soft-delete (`deletedAt`) where applicable.

| Model                    | Table                              | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Vehicle`                | `transportation_vehicles`          | `@@unique([schoolId, plateNumber])`                          |
| `Driver`                 | `transportation_drivers`           | optional `staffMemberId` / `userId` bridges                  |
| `Route`                  | `transportation_routes`            | `geofenceId` FK → `GeoFence` (SetNull); `monthlyFee`         |
| `RouteStop`              | `transportation_route_stops`       | `@@unique([schoolId, routeId, stopOrder])`                   |
| `RouteAssignment`        | `transportation_route_assignments` | `@@unique([schoolId, studentId, routeId, effectiveFrom])`    |
| `Trip`                   | `transportation_trips`             | `@@unique([schoolId, routeId, scheduledDate, direction])`    |
| `TripBoarding`           | `transportation_trip_boardings`    | `@@unique([schoolId, tripId, studentId])`                    |
| `TransportationSettings` | `transportation_settings`          | one row per school (`@@unique([schoolId])`)                  |
| `SchoolApiToken`         | `school_api_tokens`                | bcrypt `tokenHash` + 8-char `tokenPrefix`; generic, reusable |

Enums: `VehicleStatus`, `VehicleType`, `RouteStatus`, `RouteDirection`, `AssignmentStatus`, `DriverStatus`, `TripStatus`, `BoardingStatus`.

### Migrations

Located in `prisma/migrations/` — **all applied to production**:

1. `20260428083207_add_transportation` — 5 MVP tables + 6 enums
2. `20260428090000_add_transportation_trips` — Trip + TripBoarding + 2 enums
3. `20260429070000_link_route_to_geofence` — `Route.geofenceId` FK
4. `20260508000000_add_transportation_settings_and_api_tokens` — `TransportationSettings` + `SchoolApiToken`

> **DB safety:** before any further schema change, create a Neon branch first (CLAUDE.md protocol).

### Integration Points

- **GeoFence** — `Route.geofenceId` links to a `GeoFence` (intended `type=BUS_ROUTE`). When set,
  ENTER/EXIT events drive `TripBoarding` writes via `recordBoardingFromGeofence` (UI action) or the
  webhook. The route form has a geofence picker (`listAvailableGeofences`), so `geofenceId` is
  settable from the admin UI as well as the seed/SQL/webhook flow (P2-2 landed).
- **Notification** — Trip events create `Notification` rows for guardians (`type=system_alert`,
  `metadata.kind=trip_*`), rendered in the school's `preferredLanguage`, gated by per-event opt-out
  flags in `TransportationSettings`. No `NotificationType` enum migration required.
- **Finance** — `previewTransportFees()` is the canonical read-only input for fee provisioning.
  No direct `FeeRecord` writes from this block.
- **Sidebar** — `src/components/template/platform-sidebar/config.ts` (`platformNav`): 4 per-role entries
  (overview, `/fees`, `/me`, `/trips`) with the `bus` icon from `platform-sidebar/icons.tsx`. Titles are
  not yet in the `platform.sidebar` dictionary (ISSUE.md P2-10). Dashboard tiles in
  `school-dashboard/dashboard/config.ts` (`getQuickActionsByRole`) cover all 6 roles.

### Tests

Tests live at `src/tests/school-dashboard/transportation/` — run `pnpm vitest run src/tests/school-dashboard/transportation`. **313/313 green across 15 files** (verified 2026-06-14; +2 vs 2026-05-29: `stops` deleteStop boarding-history guard, `geofence-webhook-route` 429 rate-limit case):

- `authorization.test.ts` (31) — full (role × action) RBAC matrix
- `validation.test.ts` (56) — every raw Zod schema (entity + update + trip + settings), valid/invalid parses
- `multi-tenant.test.ts` (16) — `schoolId` scoping on list/count actions, permission rejections, DEVELOPER-without-school denial
- `crud-mutations.test.ts` (44) — create/update/delete/restore for vehicles/drivers/routes/assignments + ownership guards + uniqueness + overlap
- `stops.test.ts` (18) — add/update/delete + the two-phase `reorderStops` ordering invariant
- `trips-state-machine.test.ts` (30) — schedule/start/finish/cancel/recordBoarding/restore state guards + auto-populated boardings + notification dispatch
- `settings.test.ts` (12) — defaults-when-no-row, upsert, Decimal→Number coercion
- `me.test.ts` (15) — STUDENT/GUARDIAN/DEVELOPER/ADMIN branches + fall-through gate
- `notifications.test.ts` (20) — en/ar rendering, `{route}`/`{reason}` interpolation, per-event opt-out, dedup, best-effort no-throw
- `api-tokens.test.ts` (15) — mint (plaintext-once, hash-only persist), list (no hash exposed), revoke (ownership-scoped, idempotent)
- `geofence-action.test.ts` (5) — public wrapper permission gate + schoolId/recordedBy injection
- `geofence-webhook-route.test.ts` (11) — HTTP handler 401/403/400/200-ack/500 matrix + **schoolId-from-token-never-body** invariant
- `geofence-webhook.test.ts` (12) — token generate/verify + the internal boarding bridge
- `overview-reports.test.ts` (15) — expiring-doc window, recent assignments, driver-hour aggregation, trip-stat math

> Coverage spans RBAC, validation, multi-tenant scoping, the full mutating surface, the trip state
> machine, the two-phase stop reorder, settings, `/me`, notification fan-out, API tokens, and the
> geofence webhook handler. The two named hard invariants (reorder ordering, token-not-body schoolId)
> are explicitly proven. See ISSUE.md for the (closed) coverage history.

### Demo Seed

`pnpm db:seed:single transportation` (idempotent — clears the school's transportation rows first):

- 5 vehicles (BUS/VAN/MINIBUS, one MAINTENANCE, one registration expiring in ~25 days)
- 5 drivers (4 ACTIVE + 1 ON_LEAVE; one license expiring in 30 days; bridged to `position`-matched staff where present)
- 5 routes × 4 stops = 20 stops (Khartoum-area Arabic names, fees 2000–3500)
- ~15% of seeded students assigned (ROUND_TRIP, ACTIVE, effective 2 months ago)
- Trips across ±14 working days (past COMPLETED/CANCELLED, today's first route IN_PROGRESS, future SCHEDULED)
- `TripBoarding` rows for COMPLETED trips (~85% ALIGHTED, ~10% BOARDED, ~5% MISSED)
- 1 `TransportationSettings` row (defaults, `defaultMonthlyFee: 2500`)
- 1 `SchoolApiToken` `demo-geofence` — **plaintext printed once to console** (`demo-tx.<hex>`), use as `Authorization: Bearer`
