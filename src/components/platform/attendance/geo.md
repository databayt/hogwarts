I checked the tidwall/tile38 repository (tidwall/tile38). It's a popular, actively maintained Go project (Real-time Geospatial and Geofencing) with a permissive MIT license, focused on spatial indexing, real-time geofencing, live queries and streaming location events. Given your plan, Tile38 is a strong candidate to provide the geospatial backend for a real-time, location-based attendance system.

What Tile38 gives you (high level)
- Real-time geospatial store: index points, objects (GeoJSON), and do proximity queries (nearby, within).
- Geofencing and live queries: FENCE (and similar) lets you receive events when objects enter/exit/are inside/outside geo-areas — useful for attendance (entering a school/class geofence).
- Pub/sub / streaming capabilities: Tile38 can stream location events that your server can consume and forward to dashboards or notification systems.
- Redis-like interface: you can use Redis clients that can send raw commands or a Tile38-specific client for Node.js/TypeScript.
- Lightweight and purpose-built for spatial queries — less overhead than running a full spatial DB for simple, high-frequency location updates.

How it fits your multi-tenant school system
- Tenant separation: use key prefixes (school:{schoolId}:students) or separate Tile38 instances per tenant for stronger isolation.
- Data model: each student as an object keyed by studentId in a school collection; store last-known location + metadata (timestamp, deviceId, battery, status).
- Attendance logic: define geofences for school grounds, classrooms, buses, etc. Use FENCE subscriptions to detect enter/exit events and mark attendance (or validate presence during a time window).
- Real-time dashboard: Tile38 streams can be consumed by your Next.js backend (or a worker) and pushed to clients via WebSockets or Socket.IO for live maps and timelines.

Architectural sketch (recommended)
1. Mobile/web client (student app)
    - Periodically (or on significant movement) send location updates (lat, lon, timestamp, deviceId) to your Next.js API.
    - Frequency: balance accuracy vs battery (e.g., 5–30s in transit, 1–5min when static; or use motion sensors to reduce updates).

2. Next.js API / ingestion service
    - Authenticate request (tenant + student).
    - Validate and rate-limit updates.
    - Write location to Tile38 (SET or equivalent) with metadata and timestamp.
    - Optionally publish an internal event (e.g., Kafka, or Redis pub/sub) for downstream processing.

3. Tile38
    - Store student locations keyed per-tenant.
    - Use FENCE to watch geofences like school grounds and bus routes. Tile38 emits enter/exit/inside events in real-time.
    - Use NEARBY / WITHIN queries to run ad-hoc checks (e.g., who is within playground at 10:30).

4. Processing & business logic
    - A worker consumes Tile38 fence events and applies attendance rules (arrival window, late, absent) and writes attendance results to your main DB.
    - Persist historical location traces if you want to visualize “where each student spent the day” (be mindful of storage/retention and privacy).

5. Dashboard / realtime UI
    - Subscribe to processed events or directly to a stream that forwards Tile38 events to frontend (via WebSocket).
    - Provide map visualizations, timelines and alerting.

Practical integration notes (Next.js + TypeScript)
- Use a Tile38 Node client or a Redis-like client that can send raw commands to Tile38. Many Node Redis clients accept raw commands.
- Example (pseudocode, not exact command syntax — check the Tile38 docs/client you choose):
    - Write location:
        - client.sendCommand(['SET', `school:${schoolId}:students`, studentId, 'POINT', lon, lat, 'EX', '...']) // pseudocode
    - Setup a FENCE (long-lived watch):
        - client.sendCommand(['FENCE', `school:${schoolId}:fences`, 'DETECT', 'enter,exit', 'OBJECT', geojson]) // pseudocode
    - Query nearby:
        - client.sendCommand(['NEARBY', `school:${schoolId}:students`, 'POINT', lon, lat, 'RADIUS', 200]) // pseudocode
- In Next.js you can implement API routes (or a dedicated microservice) to accept location updates, and either write directly to Tile38 or push to a queue for batching.

Scaling, reliability and operations
- Volume: if you track thousands of students reporting every few seconds, the write throughput can be high. Benchmark and consider:
    - Reduce update frequency for stationary devices.
    - Batch writes where possible.
    - Use multiple Tile38 instances (sharding by tenant ranges) if a single instance becomes a bottleneck.
- Replication/backups: run replicas and periodic backups (AOF/snapshots) to avoid data loss.
- High-availability: Tile38 doesn’t offer a built-in cluster like Redis Cluster historically; consider orchestration (multiple instances + router) or separate instances per tenant for isolation.
- Monitoring: track write rate, memory usage, CPU, and latency.

Security, privacy, and compliance
- Authenticate every client update and ensure tenant isolation.
- Transport: use TLS between clients and your API, and between your API and Tile38 if exposed across networks.
- Data retention: limit how long you keep fine-grained location traces (store summaries and only retain raw traces when necessary).
- Legal/privacy: obtain consents from guardians, provide opt-outs, redact or anonymize traces where required by law (GDPR, COPPA, local regulations).

Pros and cons (quick)
- Pros:
    - Built for geospatial + real-time geofence events — good fit for attendance + tracking.
    - Lightweight, performant for spatial queries.
    - Easier to implement geofences than building geospatial indexing yourself.
- Cons / Caveats:
    - Operational burden: you must run and manage Tile38 instances.
    - Clustering/sharding limitations (research current Tile38 capabilities to confirm cluster options).
    - Accuracy depends on device GPS, network, and update frequency — can be spoofed if device is compromised.

Next steps I recommend
- Proof of concept:
    1. Run Tile38 locally (or use a managed setup).
    2. Ingest a few synthetic student locations and try NEARBY/WITHIN queries.
    3. Create a FENCE for a school boundary and verify enter/exit events.
    4. Build a tiny Next.js API route to accept updates and a small dashboard showing live positions via WebSockets.
- If you’d like, I can:
    - Produce a minimal Next.js + TypeScript example (API route + Tile38 client) showing how to accept updates and set a geofence, OR
    - Produce a sample data model for multi-tenant keys and event processing flow.

Would you like a concrete Next.js + TypeScript example (code) to start a PoC? If yes, tell me whether you prefer using a Redis client (node-redis) or a Tile38-specific npm package and I’ll produce code you can paste into your project.
