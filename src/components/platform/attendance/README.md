### Data Flow (Server-Source-of-Truth)

1. Teacher selects class and date → `getAttendanceList()` fetches roster
2. Server returns enrolled students + existing attendance marks
3. Client displays roster with status radio buttons
4. Teacher updates statuses → Submits form → `markAttendance()`
5. Server upserts attendance records, scoped by `schoolId`
6. `revalidatePath()` triggers re-fetch
7. Updated attendance shown in table

### Multi-Tenant Safety

- All queries include `schoolId` from `getTenantContext()`
- Unique constraint scoped by school: `@@unique([schoolId, studentId, classId, date])`
- Prevents cross-tenant data access
- CSV export filtered by `schoolId`

### Validation

**Client-Side:**
- Class selection required
- Date required and valid
- Status must be "present", "absent", or "late"

**Server-Side:**
- `markAttendanceSchema` validates input shape
- Status mapped to uppercase enum: PRESENT, ABSENT, LATE
- Date converted to Date object
- All records validated before upsert

### Current Behavior

- **Default Status**: Students default to "present" if not marked
- **Upsert Logic**: Updating attendance for same day overwrites previous mark
- **Bulk Marking**: Frontend can send all students in single request
- **Date Handling**: Dates normalized to midnight UTC to avoid timezone issues
- **Status Options**: Three statuses (present/absent/late), extensible for future codes

---

## Usage

The component is used in the platform dashboard at `/dashboard/attendance` and automatically handles:

- Multi-tenant data isolation (schoolId scoping)
- Class roster loading with enrollment data
- Attendance status persistence and updates
- CSV export for compliance reporting
- Date range filtering for reports
- Optimistic UI updates

---

## Dependencies

- React Hook Form for attendance marking forms
- Zod for validation schemas
- TanStack Table for attendance history display
- shadcn/ui components (Select, DatePicker, RadioGroup)
- Next.js server actions for backend operations
- Prisma for database access

---

## Technology Stack & Dependencies

This feature is built with the following technologies (see [Platform README](../README.md) for complete stack details):

### Core Framework
- **Next.js 15.4+** - App Router with Server Components ([Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs))
- **React 19+** - Server Actions, new hooks (`useActionState`, `useFormStatus`) ([Docs](https://react.dev))
- **TypeScript** - Strict mode for type safety

### Database & ORM
- **Neon PostgreSQL** - Serverless database with autoscaling ([Docs](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction))
- **Prisma ORM 6.14+** - Type-safe queries and migrations ([Docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs))

### Forms & Validation
- **React Hook Form 7.61+** - Performant form state management ([Docs](https://react-hook-form.com))
- **Zod 4.0+** - Runtime schema validation (client + server) ([Docs](https://zod.dev))

### UI Components
- **shadcn/ui** - Accessible components built on Radix UI ([Docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs))
- **TanStack Table 8.21+** - Headless table with sorting/filtering ([Docs](https://tanstack.com/table))
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling ([Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs))

### Server Actions Pattern
All mutations follow the standard server action pattern:
```typescript
"use server"
export async function performAction(input: FormData) {
  const { schoolId } = await getTenantContext()
  const validated = schema.parse(input)
  await db.model.create({ data: { ...validated, schoolId } })
  revalidatePath('/feature-path')
  return { success: true }
}
```

### Key Features
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: All queries scoped by `schoolId`
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Prisma + Zod inference
- **Server-Side Operations**: Mutations via Next.js Server Actions
- **URL State Management**: Filters and pagination synced to URL (where applicable)
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML
