## Technical Implementation

### Files and Responsibilities

- **`content.tsx`**: Server component that renders attendance marking interface
- **`table.tsx`**: Client table showing attendance records with filters
- **`columns.tsx`**: Column definitions for attendance history table
- **`actions.ts`**: Server actions for marking, fetching, and exporting attendance
- **`validation.ts`**: Zod schemas for attendance marking input

### Server Actions

**`markAttendance(input)`**
- Input: `{ classId, date, records: [{ studentId, status }] }`
- Validates with `markAttendanceSchema`
- Upserts attendance records (update if exists, create if new)
- Uses unique constraint: `schoolId_studentId_classId_date`
- Revalidates `/dashboard/attendance` path
- Returns `{ success: true }`

**`getAttendanceList(input)`**
- Input: `{ classId, date }`
- Fetches StudentClass enrollments for roster
- Fetches existing attendance marks for date
- Joins data: student info + attendance status
- Returns: `{ rows: [{ studentId, name, status }] }`
- Default status: "present" if no record exists

**`getClassesForSelection()`**
- Fetches all classes for current school
- Returns: `{ classes: [{ id, name }] }`
- Used in class dropdown selector

**`getAttendanceReportCsv(input)`**
- Input: `{ classId?, studentId?, status?, from?, to?, limit? }`
- Filters attendance records by parameters
- Supports date range filtering
- Limits to max 5000 records for performance
- Returns CSV string: `date,studentId,classId,status`
- Used for compliance reporting and data export

### Database Schema

```prisma
model Attendance {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  schoolId  String
  studentId String
  classId   String
  date      DateTime
  status    AttendanceStatus @default(PRESENT)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  school    School   @relation(fields: [schoolId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  student   Student  @relation(fields: [studentId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  class     Class    @relation(fields: [classId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([schoolId, studentId, classId, date])
  @@index([schoolId, classId, date])
  @@index([schoolId, studentId, date])
}

enum AttendanceStatus {
  PRESENT
  ABSENT
  LATE
}
```

### Data Flow (Server-Source-of-Truth)

1. Teacher selects class and date → `getAttendanceList()` fetches roster
2. Server returns enrolled students + existing attendance marks
3. Client displays roster with status radio buttons
4. Teacher updates statuses → Submits form → `markAttendance()`
5. Server upserts attendance records, scoped by `schoolId`
6. `revalidatePath()` triggers re-fetch
7. Updated attendance shown in table

### Multi-Tenant Safety

- All queries include `schoolId` from `getTenantContext()`
- Unique constraint scoped by school: `@@unique([schoolId, studentId, classId, date])`
- Prevents cross-tenant data access
- CSV export filtered by `schoolId`

### Validation

**Client-Side:**
- Class selection required
- Date required and valid
- Status must be "present", "absent", or "late"

**Server-Side:**
- `markAttendanceSchema` validates input shape
- Status mapped to uppercase enum: PRESENT, ABSENT, LATE
- Date converted to Date object
- All records validated before upsert

### Current Behavior

- **Default Status**: Students default to "present" if not marked
- **Upsert Logic**: Updating attendance for same day overwrites previous mark
- **Bulk Marking**: Frontend can send all students in single request
- **Date Handling**: Dates normalized to midnight UTC to avoid timezone issues
- **Status Options**: Three statuses (present/absent/late), extensible for future codes

- **TypeScript** - Strict mode for type safety

### Database & ORM
- **Neon PostgreSQL** - Serverless database with autoscaling ([Docs](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction))

- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling ([Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs))

### Server Actions Pattern
All mutations follow the standard server action pattern:
```typescript
"use server"
export async function performAction(input: FormData) {
  const { schoolId } = await getTenantContext()
  const validated = schema.parse(input)
  await db.model.create({ data: { ...validated, schoolId } })
  revalidatePath('/feature-path')
  return { success: true }
}
```

### Key Features
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: All queries scoped by `schoolId`
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Prisma + Zod inference
- **Server-Side Operations**: Mutations via Next.js Server Actions
- **URL State Management**: Filters and pagination synced to URL (where applicable)
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML
