The component follows the standardized file pattern:

- `content.tsx` - Main content component that renders the subjects table
- `actions.ts` - Server actions for CRUD operations
- `validation.ts` - Zod schemas for form validation
- `types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `config.ts` - Constants and configuration
- `form.tsx` - Single-step form for creating/editing subjects
- `information.tsx` - Form step for basic information
- `footer.tsx` - Form footer with navigation and progress
- `columns.tsx` - Table column definitions
- `table.tsx` - Data table component
- `list-params.ts` - Search parameters configuration
