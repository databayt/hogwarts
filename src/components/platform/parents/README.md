- `actions.ts` - Server actions for CRUD operations
- `validation.ts` - Zod schemas for form validation
- `types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `config.ts` - Constants and configuration
- `form.tsx` - Multi-step form for creating/editing parents
- `information.tsx` - First step form for basic information
- `contact.tsx` - Second step form for contact details

- `columns.tsx` - Table column definitions
- `table.tsx` - Data table component
- `list-params.ts` - Search parameters configuration
