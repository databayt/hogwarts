  "prisma": "6.14.0",
  "next-auth": "5.0.0-beta.29",

}
```

### Architecture Patterns

**Multi-Tenant SaaS:**
- Every query scoped by `schoolId` from session
- Subdomain routing: `school.databayt.org`
- JWT sessions with tenant context
- Row-level data isolation

**Server Actions Pattern:**
```typescript
"use server"
export async function createEntity(input: FormData) {
  const { schoolId } = await getTenantContext()
  const validated = schema.parse(input)
  await db.entity.create({ data: { ...validated, schoolId } })
  revalidatePath('/entities')
  return { success: true }
}
```

**Mirror Pattern:**
- Routes in `app/[lang]/s/[subdomain]/(platform)/` mirror components in `components/platform/`
- Each feature has: content.tsx, actions.ts, validation.ts, types.ts, form.tsx, columns.tsx

### Performance Requirements

**Benchmarks:**
- Page load: < 2 seconds (target)
- Time to Interactive: < 3 seconds
- Lighthouse Score: > 90
- Database query time: < 100ms (avg)

**Optimizations:**
- Database indexes on `schoolId` and foreign keys
- Connection pooling via Prisma
- SWR for client-side caching
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Image optimization with Next/Image

### Security Standards

**Authentication:**
- JWT tokens (24-hour expiry)
- HttpOnly cookies
- CSRF protection
- Session refresh (5-minute update age in production)

**Data Protection:**
- SQL injection prevention (Prisma ORM)
- XSS prevention (React auto-escaping)
- HTTPS enforced
- Secure headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)

**Multi-Tenant Isolation:**
- All queries filtered by `schoolId`
- Unique constraints scoped by tenant
- No cross-tenant data leakage
- Audit logs with `requestId` and `schoolId`
