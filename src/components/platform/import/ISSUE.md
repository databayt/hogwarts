## Technology Stack & Version Requirements

This feature uses the platform's standard technology stack (see [Platform ISSUE.md](../ISSUE.md#technology-stack--version-requirements) for complete details):

### Core Stack
- **Next.js 15.4+** with App Router and Server Components
- **React 19+** with Server Actions and new hooks
- **TypeScript 5.x** in strict mode
- **Neon PostgreSQL** with autoscaling and branching
- **Prisma ORM 6.14+** for type-safe database access

### UI & Forms
- **shadcn/ui** components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS 4** with OKLCH colors
- **React Hook Form 7.61+** for form state management
- **Zod 4.0+** for schema validation
- **TanStack Table 8.21+** for data tables

### Authentication & Security
- **NextAuth.js v5** with JWT sessions
- Multi-tenant isolation via `schoolId` scoping
- CSRF protection and secure cookie handling
- Type-safe environment variables

### Development & Testing
- **Vitest 2.0+** for unit testing
- **Playwright 1.55+** for E2E testing
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality
- **pnpm 9.x** as package manager

### Key Patterns
- **Server Actions**: All mutations use "use server" directive
- **Multi-Tenant**: Every query scoped by `schoolId` from session
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Prisma + Zod
- **Validation**: Double validation (client UX + server security)

For detailed version requirements and architecture patterns, see [Platform Technology Stack](../ISSUE.md#technology-stack--version-requirements).

## Enhanced Error Reporting (2025-10-11)

### Overview
Implemented comprehensive field-level validation with detailed, user-friendly error messages to help users understand and fix CSV import failures.

### New Features

**1. CSV Validation Helpers (`src/lib/csv-validation-helpers.ts`)**
- `formatZodError()` - Converts Zod validation errors into detailed, human-readable messages
- `validateDateFormat()` - Validates date strings (YYYY-MM-DD) with helpful suggestions
- `validatePhoneFormat()` - Validates phone numbers (7-15 digits) with format guidance
- `validateGuardianInfo()` - Ensures guardian data completeness
- `formatDuplicateError()` - Provides context for duplicate record errors
- `createRowErrorMessage()` - Formats multi-field validation errors for a single row

**2. Enhanced Import Service (`src/lib/csv-import.ts`)**
- Field-level validation before database operations
- Contextual error messages with suggestions for fixes
- Detailed error tracking with `details` field in ImportResult
- Support for warnings (non-fatal issues)
- Improved duplicate detection messages

**3. Improved UI (`src/components/platform/import/csv-import.tsx`)**
- Displays detailed error messages in collapsible format
- Shows field-level validation failures with suggestions
- Separate sections for errors and warnings
- Scrollable error list for large imports
- Error count display

### Validation Rules

**Date Validation:**
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Cannot be in the future
- Cannot be more than 100 years ago
- Example: "2008-05-15"

**Phone Validation:**
- Length: 7-15 digits
- Allowed characters: digits, spaces, dashes, parentheses, plus sign
- Example: "+1234567890" or "123-456-7890"

**Guardian Validation:**
- If guardian info provided, name is required
- If guardian info provided, at least one contact method (email or phone) required
- Helps prevent incomplete guardian records

**Duplicate Detection:**
- Student ID uniqueness within school
- Employee ID uniqueness within school
- Email uniqueness within school
- Provides context: which field is duplicate and what value

### Error Message Examples

**Before:**
```
Row 15: Invalid email
```

**After:**
```
Row 15: Validation failed
  ‚Ä¢ guardianEmail: Invalid email address
    ‚Ñπ Example: student@example.com
    üì• Received: "parent@invalid"
```

**Before:**
```
Row 23: Student ID STD123 already exists
```

**After:**
```
Row 23: Duplicate studentId: "STD123" already exists in the system. Each student must have a unique studentId.
Details: This student ID is already registered in the system. Please use a unique student ID.
```

### Impact
- **Reduced Support Burden**: Users can self-diagnose and fix import errors
- **Faster Onboarding**: Schools can import data correctly on first attempt
- **Better UX**: Clear, actionable error messages with suggestions
- **Data Quality**: Validation catches format issues before database insertion
