- Returns `{ success: true, id }`

**`updateExam(input)`**
- Input: `{ id, ...fields to update }`
- Validates with `examUpdateSchema`
- Updates only provided fields
- Uses `updateMany` with schoolId filter for security
- Revalidates path
- Returns `{ success: true }`

**`deleteExam(input)`**
- Input: `{ id }`
- Uses `deleteMany` with schoolId filter
- Cascades to exam results (if configured)
- Revalidates path
- Returns `{ success: true }`

### Database Schema

```prisma
model Exam {
  id           String       @id @default(cuid())
  schoolId     String
  title        String
  description  String?
  classId      String
  subjectId    String
  examDate     DateTime
  startTime    String
  endTime      String
  duration     Int          // minutes
  totalMarks   Int
  passingMarks Int
  examType     ExamType
  instructions String?
  status       ExamStatus   @default(PLANNED)
  createdAt    DateTime     @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime     @updatedAt

  school       School       @relation(fields: [schoolId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  class        Class        @relation(fields: [classId], references: [id])
  subject      Subject      @relation(fields: [subjectId], references: [id])
  results      ExamResult[]

  @@index([schoolId, examDate])
  @@index([schoolId, classId])
  @@index([schoolId, subjectId])
}

enum ExamType {
  MIDTERM
  FINAL
  QUIZ
  TEST
  PRACTICAL
}

enum ExamStatus {
  PLANNED
  IN_PROGRESS
  COMPLETED
  CANCELLED
}
```

### Multi-Tenant Safety

- All queries include `schoolId` from `getTenantContext()`
- Update and delete use `updateMany`/`deleteMany` with schoolId filter
- Prevents cross-tenant data access
- Foreign keys enforce referential integrity

### Validation

**Client-Side:**
- Title required, min 3 characters
- Class and subject selection required
- Exam date required
- Start/end times required
- Total marks > 0
- Passing marks ‚â§ total marks

**Server-Side:**
- `examCreateSchema` validates all fields
- Date parsing and normalization
- Status enum validation
- Exam type enum validation

---

## Usage

The component is used in the platform dashboard at `/dashboard/exams` and automatically handles:

- Multi-tenant data isolation (schoolId scoping)
- Multi-step form state management
- Server-side validation
- Optimistic updates
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

---

## Dependencies

- React Hook Form for form management
- Zod for validation
- TanStack Table for data display
- shadcn/ui components (DatePicker, Select, Input, Textarea)
- Next.js server actions for backend operations
- Prisma for database access

---

## Technology Stack & Dependencies

This feature is built with the following technologies (see [Platform README](../README.md) for complete stack details):

### Core Framework
- **Next.js 15.4+** - App Router with Server Components ([Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs))
- **React 19+** - Server Actions, new hooks (`useActionState`, `useFormStatus`) ([Docs](https://react.dev))
- **TypeScript** - Strict mode for type safety

### Database & ORM
- **Neon PostgreSQL** - Serverless database with autoscaling ([Docs](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction))
- **Prisma ORM 6.14+** - Type-safe queries and migrations ([Docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs))

### Forms & Validation
- **React Hook Form 7.61+** - Performant form state management ([Docs](https://react-hook-form.com))
- **Zod 4.0+** - Runtime schema validation (client + server) ([Docs](https://zod.dev))

### UI Components
- **shadcn/ui** - Accessible components built on Radix UI ([Docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs))
- **TanStack Table 8.21+** - Headless table with sorting/filtering ([Docs](https://tanstack.com/table))
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling ([Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs))

### Server Actions Pattern
All mutations follow the standard server action pattern:
```typescript
"use server"
export async function performAction(input: FormData) {
  const { schoolId } = await getTenantContext()
  const validated = schema.parse(input)
  await db.model.create({ data: { ...validated, schoolId } })
  revalidatePath('/feature-path')
  return { success: true }
}
```

### Key Features
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: All queries scoped by `schoolId`
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Prisma + Zod inference
- **Server-Side Operations**: Mutations via Next.js Server Actions
- **URL State Management**: Filters and pagination synced to URL (where applicable)
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML
