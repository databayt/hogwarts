## Technology Stack & Dependencies

This feature is built with the following technologies (see [Platform README](../README.md) for complete stack details):

### Core Framework
- **Next.js 15.4+** - App Router with Server Components ([Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs))
- **React 19+** - Server Actions, new hooks (`useActionState`, `useFormStatus`) ([Docs](https://react.dev))
- **TypeScript** - Strict mode for type safety

### Database & ORM
- **Neon PostgreSQL** - Serverless database with autoscaling ([Docs](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction))
- **Prisma ORM 6.14+** - Type-safe queries and migrations ([Docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs))

### Forms & Validation
- **React Hook Form 7.61+** - Performant form state management ([Docs](https://react-hook-form.com))
- **Zod 4.0+** - Runtime schema validation (client + server) ([Docs](https://zod.dev))

### UI Components
- **shadcn/ui** - Accessible components built on Radix UI ([Docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs))
- **TanStack Table 8.21+** - Headless table with sorting/filtering ([Docs](https://tanstack.com/table))
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling ([Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs))

### Server Actions Pattern
All mutations follow the standard server action pattern:
```typescript
"use server"
export async function performAction(input: FormData) {
  const { schoolId } = await getTenantContext()
  const validated = schema.parse(input)
  await db.model.create({ data: { ...validated, schoolId } })
  revalidatePath('/feature-path')
  return { success: true }
}
```

### Key Features
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: All queries scoped by `schoolId`
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Prisma + Zod inference
- **Server-Side Operations**: Mutations via Next.js Server Actions
- **URL State Management**: Filters and pagination synced to URL (where applicable)
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML
