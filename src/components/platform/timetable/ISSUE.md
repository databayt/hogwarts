## Polish & Enhancement Items

### Critical Issues (Priority 1) üî¥

**TypeScript Violations** ‚úÖ FIXED 2025-10-11
- [x] **timetable.ts** - Removed all `any` types from safe fetch helper and store (10 instances)
- [x] **timetable-header.tsx** - Fixed generic type parameter and API response types (2 instances)
- [x] **timetable-grid.tsx** - Replaced `any` with `LegacyTimetableData` type (1 instance)
- [x] **timetable-grid-enhanced.tsx** - Fixed DnD item types and dictionary type (4 instances)
- [x] **types.ts** - Added comprehensive type interfaces for API responses and legacy data
- [x] Created proper TypeScript interfaces for all timetable components

  - Added `LegacyTimetableData` and `LegacyTimetableCell` for backward compatibility
  - Added `TimetableDictionary` for i18n support
  - Added `DragItem` for type-safe drag-and-drop

### Typography Violations ‚úÖ FIXED 2025-10-11
- [x] Replaced all hardcoded text-* classes with semantic HTML
- [x] Use typography system from globals.css (.muted, <small>, h2-h6, <p>)
- [x] Ensured all text follows semantic HTML patterns
- Fixed 9 files:
  - timetable-header.tsx (h1 ‚Üí h2, p with lead class, small for badges)
  - timetable-grid.tsx (h6 for headers, small + p.muted for times)
  - timetable-cell.tsx (h6 for subject names, p + small for teacher info)
  - teacher-info-popup.tsx (removed font-medium, used muted class)
  - conflicts-drawer.tsx (h6 for titles, p.muted for descriptions, small for labels)
  - config-dialog.tsx (p.muted for messages, small for school codes)
  - slot-editor.tsx (p.muted for suggestions)
  - subject-selector.tsx (div.muted for info text)
  - timetable-grid-enhanced.tsx (small in Badge component)

### Performance Issues
- [ ] Add React.memo to TimetableCell component
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large timetables
- [ ] Optimize conflict detection algorithm
- [ ] Cache frequently accessed timetable data
- [ ] Add pagination for teacher/class lists

### Accessibility Requirements
- [ ] Implement ARIA grid pattern for timetable
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- [ ] Add focus management for cells
- [ ] Create screen reader announcements
- [ ] Add skip navigation links

## Database & Migrations
- [x] Add `Timetable` model scoped by `schoolId` with uniqueness for teacher/room/class collisions
  - [x] Fields: `id, schoolId, termId, dayOfWeek, periodId, classId, teacherId, classroomId, weekOffset?`
  - [x] Constraints: unique triples for (teacher, period, day), (classroom, period, day), (class, period, day)
  - [x] Indexes on `schoolId, termId, dayOfWeek, periodId`
- [x] Add `SchoolWeekConfig` (per school/per term) to support flexible work days and lunch breaks
  - [x] Fields: `workingDays int[]`, `defaultLunchAfterPeriod? number`, `extraLunchRules? JSON`
  - [x] Unique `@@unique([schoolId, termId])`
- [ ] Optional: `GradeScheduleConfig` and `ClassScheduleConfig` (post-MVP)
- [x] Prisma migrate dev (applied)
- [x] Prisma generate (applied)
- [x] Seed slots and configs for local dev

## Server Actions
- [x] `getScheduleConfig({ termId })` resolves working days and lunch policy
- [x] `getWeeklyTimetable({ termId, weekOffset?, view?{ classId?, teacherId? } })` returns UI JSON (days + lunch row handling)
- [x] `upsertTimetableSlot(input)` with tenant/role checks (ADMIN/OWNER)
- [ ] Optional: `moveSlot`/`swapSlots` helpers (low priority)
- [x] Extend `detectTimetableConflicts` to read from `Timetable`
- [x] Ensure all actions include `schoolId` from `getTenantContext()`

## UI Store & Wiring
- [x] Replace fetches in `useTimetableStore.fetchTimetable`/`changeWeek` to call internal API backed by server actions
- [x] Load schedule config (days via `getWeeklyTimetable`) and feed into grid (removed hardcoded Mon‚ÄìFri)
- [x] Keep `config.json.useLocalJson` as fallback for demos; default to server
- [x] Add term and view selectors (class/teacher; grades with A/B/C/D classes)
- [x] Preserve teacher info overrides (cookies) in MVP
- [x] Wire selectors to refetch weekly timetable via `/api/timetable` with params
- [x] Insert lunch row based on server-provided `lunchAfterPeriod` (fallback to client config)

## Components
- [x] `TimetableHeader`: add term selector and view switch (Class vs Teacher)
- [x] Class selection supports grades with multiple classes (A/B/C/D)
- [x] Teacher selector for teacher timetable view
- [x] `TimetableGrid`: render dynamic days and lunch row position
- [x] Print view: A4 helpers (page breaks, prevent row splits)
- [ ] Print view: final tuning (fonts/margins for varied day counts)

## Admin Configuration & Conflicts
- [x] API: upsert schedule config (working days/lunch)
- [x] API: upsert timetable slot
- [x] Server action stub to save schedule config (revalidate)
- [x] Admin settings UI (dialog) to manage working days and lunch
- [x] Basic slot editor (dialog form) to create/update slots
- [x] Conflict count surfaced in header; endpoint at `/api/timetable/conflicts`
- [x] Suggestions endpoint `/api/timetable/suggest` and UI list in slot editor
- [x] Conflicts drawer with suggestions; "Apply" pre-fills slot editor
- [ ] Role checks: mutations only for `ADMIN`/`OWNER`

## Permissions & Multi-tenant
- [x] Scope all DB queries by `schoolId`
- [x] Add tests for tenant isolation (Vitest)

## Tests
- [x] Unit: schedule resolution (days/lunch), formatting, conflicts
- [ ] Integration: overlapping slots produce conflicts; different weekend patterns render correctly
- [ ] Update existing `actions.test.ts` to cover slot-based conflicts (extend)

## Docs
- [x] Keep `README.md` updated (flexible days/lunch, class/teacher views, A4 print)
- [x] Admin guide (configure working days/lunch; resolve conflicts)

## QA
- [ ] Validate Fri off; Fri+Sat off; Fri+Sun off; renders correct columns
- [ ] Validate lunch after 2/3/4 periods (and per-class override)
- [ ] Switch Class vs Teacher views
- [ ] Grades with multiple classes (A/B/C/D) selection works
- [ ] Conflict detection surfaces realistic conflicts
- [ ] RTL and A4 print correctness

## Commands
- `pnpm vitest run`
- `pnpm prisma migrate dev && pnpm prisma generate`
- `pnpm dev`
- `pnpm build`

## Technology Stack & Version Requirements

This feature uses the platform's standard technology stack (see [Platform ISSUE.md](../ISSUE.md#technology-stack--version-requirements) for complete details):

### Core Stack
- **Next.js 15.4+** with App Router and Server Components
- **React 19+** with Server Actions and new hooks
- **TypeScript 5.x** in strict mode
- **Neon PostgreSQL** with autoscaling and branching
- **Prisma ORM 6.14+** for type-safe database access

### UI & Forms
- **shadcn/ui** components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS 4** with OKLCH colors
- **React Hook Form 7.61+** for form state management
- **Zod 4.0+** for schema validation
- **TanStack Table 8.21+** for data tables

### Authentication & Security
- **NextAuth.js v5** with JWT sessions
- Multi-tenant isolation via `schoolId` scoping
- CSRF protection and secure cookie handling
- Type-safe environment variables

### Development & Testing
- **Vitest 2.0+** for unit testing
- **Playwright 1.55+** for E2E testing
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality
- **pnpm 9.x** as package manager

### Key Patterns
- **Server Actions**: All mutations use "use server" directive
- **Multi-Tenant**: Every query scoped by `schoolId` from session
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Prisma + Zod
- **Validation**: Double validation (client UX + server security)

For detailed version requirements and architecture patterns, see [Platform Technology Stack](../ISSUE.md#technology-stack--version-requirements).

## Recent Updates

### 2025-10-11: Typography Violations Fixed ‚úÖ
Fixed all typography violations by replacing hardcoded text-*/font-* classes with semantic HTML and typography system:
- **Semantic HTML**: Replaced all `<div>` and `<span>` text elements with proper semantic tags (h2-h6, p, small)
- **Typography Classes**: Used `.muted` class instead of `text-sm text-muted-foreground` throughout
- **Consistent Styling**: All headings now use semantic h2-h6 tags with automatic styling from typography.css
- **Badge Components**: Wrapped badge text in `<small>` tags for proper semantic meaning
- **9 files modified**: timetable-header, timetable-grid, timetable-cell, teacher-info-popup, conflicts-drawer, config-dialog, slot-editor, subject-selector, timetable-grid-enhanced

**Impact**: All timetable components now follow the platform's typography system, improving consistency, maintainability, and accessibility

### 2025-10-11: TypeScript Violations Fixed ‚úÖ
Fixed all critical TypeScript violations in core timetable files:
- **timetable.ts**: Extracted `safeFetchJson` as standalone function with proper generics, replaced all `(get() as any)._safeFetchJson` calls
- **timetable-header.tsx**: Changed generic default from `any` to `unknown`, added proper API response types
- **timetable-grid.tsx**: Replaced `any` with `LegacyTimetableData | null` for timetableData prop
- **timetable-grid-enhanced.tsx**: Added `DragItem` and `TimetableDictionary` types for type-safe DnD and i18n
- **types.ts**: Added 8 new TypeScript interfaces for comprehensive type coverage

**Impact**: All core timetable components now have proper TypeScript typing, eliminating 17 `any` type violations
