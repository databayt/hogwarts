  const validated = paymentSchema.parse(data)

  // Use transaction for consistency
  const result = await db.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    // Generate unique receipt number
    const receiptNumber = await generateReceiptNumber(schoolId)

    // Create payment record
    const payment = await tx.payment.create({
      data: {
        ...validated,
        schoolId,
        receiptNumber,
        collectedBy: session.user.id,
        status: 'SUCCESS'
      }
    })

    // Update student fee account
    const studentFee = await tx.studentFee.update({
      where: { id: validated.studentFeeId },
      data: {
        paidAmount: { increment: validated.amount },
        outstandingAmount: { decrement: validated.amount },
        lastPaymentDate: new Date(),
        status: calculateStatus(/* ... */)
      }
    })

    // Log transaction for audit
    await tx.auditLog.create({
      data: {
        schoolId,
        action: 'PAYMENT_COLLECTED',
        entityType: 'Payment',
        entityId: payment.id,
        userId: session.user.id,
        metadata: { amount: validated.amount }
      }
    })

    return { payment, studentFee }
  })

  // Send receipt via email
  await sendPaymentReceipt(result.payment)

  revalidatePath('/fees/collection')
  return {
    success: true,
    receiptNumber: result.payment.receiptNumber
  }
}
```
