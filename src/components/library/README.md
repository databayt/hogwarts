# Library Block

School library management system with global-first catalog, borrowing, admin tools, and community contributions.

## Architecture

```
CatalogBook (global, no schoolId)
    |
    |-- SchoolBookSelection (bridge: schoolId + catalogBookId)
    |       isActive: false = book hidden for this school
    |       No record = book visible (default)
    |
    |-- Book (school-scoped, lazy-created on detail page visit)
            |
            |-- BorrowRecord (school-scoped, tracks borrow/return)
```

**Global-first**: All schools see all published/approved CatalogBooks out of the box. No provisioning or onboarding wiring needed. Schools can hide individual books or groups via SchoolBookSelection.

**Lazy provisioning**: When a user visits a book detail page, a school-scoped Book record is auto-created from the CatalogBook. This Book is used for borrow/return tracking.

## Data Flow

### Library Home (`content.tsx`)

1. `getTenantContext()` for schoolId
2. Query `SchoolBookSelection` where `isActive: false` to get hidden book IDs
3. Query `CatalogBook` (published + approved + public/school visibility), excluding hidden
4. Map to `BookListItem[]` (lightweight type) for BookList/BookCard

### Book Detail (`book-detail/content.tsx`)

1. Load `CatalogBook` by ID (global lookup)
2. Check if school has hidden this book via `SchoolBookSelection`
3. Find or create school-scoped `Book` from CatalogBook data (lazy provisioning)
4. Load borrow status from school-scoped `BorrowRecord`
5. Load related books from `CatalogBook` (same author, same genre)

### All Books (`book-list/all-books-content.tsx`)

1. Same global CatalogBook query as homepage
2. Adds search, genre filter, grade level filter
3. Server-side pagination

### Borrow/Return (`actions.ts`)

1. `borrowBook`: Validates school Book exists, checks availability, creates BorrowRecord in transaction
2. `returnBook`: Validates BorrowRecord belongs to school, updates status + copies in transaction

## Types

- `BookListItem` -- lightweight display type (id, title, author, genre, coverUrl, coverColor, rating, createdAt). Used by BookList and BookCard. Compatible with both CatalogBook and Book shapes.
- `Book` -- full school-scoped type with description, copies, summary, gradeLevel, ISBN, etc.
- `BorrowRecord` -- tracks who borrowed what, with status (BORROWED/RETURNED/OVERDUE).
