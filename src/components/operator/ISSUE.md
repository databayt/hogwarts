## Operator Block ‚Äî Backlog and Acceptance Criteria

This is the canonical backlog to bring the Operator block to "ready" for MVP per docs. Use small, typed, composable edits following shadcn/ui and mirror patterns. All queries/mutations must include `schoolId`.

Status legend: [x] done, [~] in progress, [ ] todo

## Critical Architecture Issues (Priority 1) üî¥

### Mirror Pattern Violation
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Move `src/components/operator/` to `src/components/platform/operator/`
- [ ] Update all imports in app directory from `/operator/` to `/platform/operator/`
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect correct paths
- [ ] Ensure route mirrors component path correctly

### Typography System Violations (30+ instances)
- [ ] Replace all hardcoded text-* classes with semantic HTML
  - [ ] `tenants/content.tsx`: Lines 121, 136, 140, 145, 149, 156, 160, 177, 192-193
  - [ ] `billing/content.tsx`: Lines 42-43, 56-57, 71-72
  - [ ] `app-sidebar.tsx`: Line 34
  - [ ] `product/detail.tsx`: Lines 15-16
  - [ ] All other instances across codebase
- [ ] Use typography system from `src/styles/typography.css`
- [ ] Add typography validation to CI pipeline
- [ ] Run typography-refactor agent on all affected files

### TypeScript Type Safety Violations
- [ ] Fix all `any` type usage (30+ instances found)
- [ ] Replace `(db as any)` with properly typed Prisma client
- [ ] Add proper type definitions for all interfaces
- [ ] Enable ESLint rule: `"@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "error"`

## Standardization Issues (Priority 2) ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Missing Required Files Per Feature
For each feature (tenants, billing, domains, observability, kanban, products):
- [ ] Create `type.ts` - Shared TypeScript types
- [ ] Create `form.tsx` - Form components for data entry
- [ ] Create `util.ts` - Feature-specific utilities
- [ ] Create `constant.ts` - Arrays, enums, static data
- [ ] Create `card.tsx` - Card components
- [ ] Create `all.tsx` - All/list views
- [ ] Create `featured.tsx` - Featured list components

### Component Hierarchy Issues
- [ ] Create atomic components in `src/components/atom/`
- [ ] Refactor direct UI usage to use intermediate abstractions
- [ ] Implement proper progression: UI ‚Üí Atoms ‚Üí Templates ‚Üí Features
- [ ] Create reusable empty state component
- [ ] Standardize loading patterns across features

## Performance Issues (Priority 3) üöÄ

### Client-Side Data Fetching
- [ ] Convert `tenants/content.tsx` to use server-side data fetching
- [ ] Remove `useEffect` for data loading in favor of server components
- [ ] Add proper loading.tsx files for each route
- [ ] Implement suspense boundaries for async operations

### Missing Optimizations
- [ ] Add React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for heavy features
- [ ] Add code splitting for large modules
- [ ] Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports

## Testing Gaps (Priority 4) üß™

### Missing Test Coverage
- [ ] Add `content.test.tsx` for all content components
- [ ] Create UI interaction tests with React Testing Library
- [ ] Add typography validation tests
- [ ] Implement accessibility tests with @testing-library
- [ ] Add performance tests for data-heavy components
- [ ] Create integration tests for multi-tenant safety

## React Best Practices (Priority 5) ‚öõÔ∏è

### Component Issues
- [ ] Split large components (300+ lines) into smaller units
- [ ] Fix hydration mismatch risks from client-side checks
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add comprehensive loading states
- [ ] Fix missing key props in list iterations

### State Management
- [ ] Remove unnecessary client-side state
- [ ] Use server actions for all mutations
- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- [ ] Add proper error handling for async operations

## UI/UX Issues (Priority 6) üé®

### Accessibility
- [ ] Add ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- [ ] Implement proper focus management for modals/drawers
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation for all features
- [ ] Add sr-only labels for icon-only buttons
- [ ] Test with screen readers

### Dark Mode & Theming
- [ ] Ensure all components use theme variables
- [ ] Fix any hardcoded colors
- [ ] Test dark mode across all features
- [ ] Implement proper theme switching

### RTL Support
- [ ] Use CSS logical properties instead of directional
- [ ] Remove hardcoded dir attributes
- [ ] Test all components in Arabic locale
- [ ] Fix any RTL layout issues

## Original Backlog (Continue Implementation)

### 1) Tenants ‚Äî List, Filters, Detail

- [~] Implement tenants data table with server-driven pagination, sorting, filtering
  - [x] Columns: name, domain, planType, isActive
  - [x] URL state via `nuqs` (page, perPage, sort, column filters)
  - [x] Server maps filters to Prisma `where`; sorting to `orderBy`
  - [x] Add `createdAt`, `trialEndsAt` to columns and sort options (createdAt sortable; trialEndsAt display)
  - [x] Ensure `pageCount` from server drives pagination
  - [x] Add search box that targets name/domain (hooked into global `search` param)
  - Acceptance: p95 < 2s; URL state persists; `schoolId` scoping enforced in all queries
- [~] Tenant detail drawer/page
  - Overview: plan, usage, domain(s), owner(s)
  - [x] Actions: start/stop impersonation, toggle active (suspend/activate), change plan, end trial
  - [x] Overview with owners and usage metrics (students, teachers, classes)
  - [x] Billing snapshot (plan, outstanding, trial, next invoice)
  - [x] Recent invoices list (last 10)
  - Acceptance: actions are server-validated (Zod), audit entries created

### 2) Domains ‚Äî Subdomains and Custom Domains

- [~] Domains list table
  - [x] Server fetch from `DomainRequest` with tenant name
  - [x] Actions: approve, reject, verify (server actions wired, audit logged)
  - [x] Add pagination and filters; show createdAt and status badges
  - Acceptance: server is source of truth; verification status reflects backend
- [x] Custom domain request flow
  - [x] Form: hostname, tenant selection, notes
  - [x] Server Action: persist request with `schoolId` and audit
  - Acceptance: success path revalidates domains list; validation via Zod

### 3) Billing ‚Äî Plans, Invoices, Manual Receipts

- [ ] Billing overview per tenant
  - Shows plan, trial countdown, next invoice date, outstanding balance
  - [x] Snapshot in tenant detail (read-only)
  - Acceptance: matches data model and handles trial/grace states
- [~] Invoices table

  - [x] Wire switcher to metrics endpoint and card deltas
  - Acceptance: lightweight queries, resilient UI

### 6) Impersonation ‚Äî Safe Operator Tools
